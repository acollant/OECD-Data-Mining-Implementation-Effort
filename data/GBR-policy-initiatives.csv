From helping us deal with the novel ethical issues raised by rapidly-developing technologies such as artificial intelligence, agreeing best practice around data use to identifying potential new regulations, the Centre will set out the measures needed to build trust and enable innovation in data-driven technologies. Trust underpins a strong economy, and trust in data underpins a strong digital economy.<br/><br/>It will identify the measures needed to strengthen and improve the way data and AI are used and regulated. This will include articulating best practice and advising on how we address potential gaps in regulation. The Centre will not, itself, regulate the use of data and AI - its role will be to help ensure that those who govern and regulate the use of data across sectors do so effectively.<br/>The Centre will operate by drawing on evidence and insights from across regulators, academia, the public and business. It will translate these into recommendations and actions that deliver direct, real world impact on the way that data and AI is used. The Centre will have a unique role in the landscape, acting as the authoritative source of advice to government on the governance of data and AI.<br/>Across its work, the Centre will seek to deliver the best possible outcomes for society from the use of data and AI. This includes supporting innovative and ethical uses of data and AI. These objectives will be mutually reinforcing: by ensuring data and AI are used ethically, the Centre will promote trust in these technologies, which will in turn help to drive the growth of responsible innovation and strengthen the UK’s position as one of the most trusted places in the world for data-driven businesses to invest in.<br/><br/>The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation will maximise the exceptional benefits of data and AI for our society and economy. The Centre will:<br/><br/>Analyse and Anticipate<br/>The Centre will identify the barriers to and opportunities for ethical and innovative uses of data and AI by:<br/><br/>a. commissioning and bringing together research and analysis into the ethical and economic implications of uses of data and AI<br/><br/>b. reviewing the existing regulatory framework and identifying gaps in response to the uses of data and AI and barriers to ethical innovation<br/><br/>c. engaging industry, civil society, regulators and the public in consultation and dialogue on specific issues around data and AI uses<br/><br/>d. horizon-scanning new and emerging data-driven and AI-based technologies and associated governance implications.<br/><br/>Agree and Articulate Best Practice<br/>The Centre will identify best practice for the responsible use of data and AI.

As part of this, the government is exploring data sharing frameworks such as Data Trusts - mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shared data - in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability. This will allow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organizations in the private sector, and between the private and public sectors.<br/>To develop fair, equitable and secure data sharing frameworks, the UK will:<br/>• Work with major data holders in both the private and public sectors, along with the data science community, to identify barriers to sharing data.<br/>• Work with industry to explore frameworks and mechanisms for safe, secure and equitable data transfer such as Data Trusts.<br/>• Deliver a strong digital and telecommunications infrastructure across the UK:<br/>• Reach 95% superfast broadband coverage.<br/>• Invest over £1 billion to develop 5G mobile networks and extend full fibre broadband to build the next generation digital infrastructure.<br/>• Establish the Geospatial Commission to determine how best to improve access to geospatial data to a wider range of users, including businesses using and innovating with AI technologies. The government is committed to opening up more data in a way that makes it reusable and easily accessible. A good example is geospatial data. The Geospatial Commission announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget will provide strategic oversight to the various public bodies who hold geospatial data, seeking to maximise the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the best place to start and grow a digital business. <br/>To further boost the digital economy, the government is working with the Ordnance Survey (OS) and the new Commission to establish how to open up freely the OS MasterMap data to UK-based small businesses in particular.

These pilots focused on diverse challenges: tackling illegal, wildlife trade, reducing food waste, and improving public services in Greenwich.<br/>The findings and recommendations of these pilots were published in April 2019.<br/>The work found a huge demand from private, public and third sector organisations to explore data trusts and other data stewardship models to unblock data sharing. The research focused on the first stages of the data trust life-cycle; scoping and co-design. It found a number of different potential benefits that the data trust approach to data sharing could help to bring. These included: <br/>• helping to balance conflicting views and incentives about how data should be shared and who can access it;<br/>• reducing costs and skills needed to steward and share data; and <br/>• making control more representative over how data is used and shared and ensuring data’s benefits are distributed more widely, ethically and equitably.<br/><br/>The creation of open data hubs is becoming commonplace in the UK and abroad, with numerous cities launching their own in recent years.
