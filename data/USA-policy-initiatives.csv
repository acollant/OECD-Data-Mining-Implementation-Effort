Companies, workers, parents, and policymakers have traditionally assumed that a university degree is the best, or only, path to a middle-class career. Employers and job seekers should be aware of multiple career pathways and skill development opportunities outside of traditional 4-year degrees.To increase Data Transparency to Better Match American Workers with American Jobs. High-quality, transparent, and timely data can significantly improve the ability of employers, students, job seekers, education providers, and policymakers to make informed choices about education and employment—especially for matching education and training programs to in-demand jobs and the skills needed to fill them.To modernize Candidate Recruitment and Training Practices. Employers often struggle to fill job vacancies, yet their hiring practices may actually reduce the pool of qualified job applicants. To acquire a talented workforce, employers must better identify the skills needed for specific jobs and communicate those needs to education providers, job seekers, and students.To measure and Encourage Employer-led Training Investments. The size, scope, and impacts of education and skills training investments are still not fully understood. There is a lack of consistent data on company balance sheets and in federal statistics.

The role of the Jefferson Science Fellows is both to advise and educate. They use their professional experience to increase the understanding among policy officials of complex, cutting edge scientific issues and their possible impacts on U.S. foreign policy and international relations. By bridging the science and policy worlds, they are able to advise policy makers on available policy options to address solutions for emerging international scientific issues. Following the fellowship year, the Jefferson Science Fellow will return to his/her academic career, but will remain available to the U.S. Department of State/USAID to serve as subject matter experts for a minimum of five years.<br/><br/>The Jefferson Science Fellowship is open to scientists and engineers who are tenured faculty from U.S. institutions of higher learning.

To facilitate this, the IC must continue to implement policies to break down traditional INT stovepipes.Objective 4 – Long term – Invest in Basic Research Focused on Sense-Making: It is not enough to simply fuse information from multiple modalities together in response to a single, narrow task.

The updated guidance, 2.0, offers a flexible, nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle technology safety, by supporting the automotive industry and other key stakeholders as they consider and design best practices for the safe testing and deployment of ADS levels 3 through 5. It also provides technical assistance to states and best practices for policymakers regarding ADS.<br/><br/>In October 2018, U.S. DOT released Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0, which builds upon — but does not replace — the voluntary guidance provided in 2.0.

AV 3.0 is structured around three key areas:<br/><br/>Advancing multi-modal safety,<br/>Reducing policy uncertainty, and<br/>Outlining a process for working with U.S. DOT.<br/>The U.S. DOT sees AV 3.0 as the beginning of a national discussion about the future of our on-road surface transportation system.
