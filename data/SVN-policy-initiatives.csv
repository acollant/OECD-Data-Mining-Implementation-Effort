The tasks of the interministerial working group are:<br/>• examination of the state of artificial intelligence in the country;<br/>• an examination of possible foreign good practices in this field;<br/>• drafting proposals for systematic regulation of the field;<br/>• aligning systemic proposals with country and EU strategy papers;<br/>• preparation of the final proposal of the national artificial intelligence strategy.","2019","","","In its strategy on AI for Europe, the European Commission proposed to work with Member States on a coordinated plan on AI by the end of 2018, with the aim to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices and collectively define the way forward to ensure that the EU as a whole can compete globally. The proposal of a coordinated plan built on the declaration of cooperation on AI launched in April 2018 at the Digital Day and signed by all Member States and Norway. It was endorsed by the European Council in June 2018.<br/>The coordinated plan details actions to be started in 2019-2020 and prepares the ground for activities in the following years. It will be reviewed and updated annually. The main objectives and initiatives of the plan are to provide a strategic framework for national AI strategies. Member States are encouraged to develop their national AI strategy by mid-2019, building on the work done at the European level.<br/><br/>Activities on EU level: Slovenia signs the European Declarations on the of Artificial Intelligence, April 2018.<br/><br/>On the basis of the European Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Europe COM (2018) 237 and the Coordinated Artificial Intelligence Plan COM (2018) 795, the Ministry of Public Administration has undertaken activities to prepare a national artificial intelligence strategy. On the Directorate for the Information Society has prepared the first draft strategy, which is the subject of broader inter-ministerial coordination.<br/>For this purpose, an inter-ministerial working group has been set up, consisting of representatives from different ministries and government departments, as we believe that the field of artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary field that must cover different views and proposals for solutions. Representatives of external stakeholders (Slovenian Digital Coalition, Slovenian Society for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Champion of Slovenia, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia, SRIP PMiS - Smart Cities and Communities, SRIP ToP - Factories of the Future, IJS, Faculty of Computer Science) also participate in the work of the interdepartmental working group.","Slovenija aims at establishing efficient support to research and deployment of artificial intelligence by 2020 by enhanced and systematic networking of relevant stakeholders. This will be achieved by education and financial incentives to public and privat sector.The strategy focus on three main areas:<br/>• strengthening technological and industrial capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence,<br/>• responding to socio-economic changes such as changes in the labor market and education system,<br/>• providing an appropriate ethical and legal framework.Important goal is to ensure appropriate ethical and legal framework and to increase trust of the citizens in the artificial intelligence.The Strategy aims to establish a system to support the development, deployment and monitoring of artificial intelligence and to accelerate the processes of digitization in Slovenia. By 2025, Slovenia will establish an effective system to support the research and deployment of artificial intelligence.The following areas of action are being formulated:<br/>1. strengthening and systematic regulation of stakeholder networking;<br/>2. education and strengthening of human resources;<br/>3. increasing financial support and encouraging the public and private sector for artificial intelligence research;<br/>4. preparing the economy and society for change;<br/>5. data, the foundation of artificial intelligence;<br/>6. use of artificial intelligence to enhance security;<br/>7. raising the individual's confidence in artificial intelligence;<br/>8. providing an appropriate legal and ethical framework;<br/>9. use of artificial intelligence in the public sector;<br/>10. strengthening international cooperation;<br/>11. monitoring the development and use of artificial intelligence.","Ministry of Public Administration (MJU;Ministrstvo za javno upravo)","http://mju.arhiv-spletisc.gov.si/si/delovna_podrocja/informacijska_druzba/umetna_inteligenca/","false","","Not applicable","Slovenia","Emerging trends in STI policy|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Digital transformation of firms|Ethics of emerging technologies","Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations","Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|National government|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Technology transfer offices","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/14677/instrument/17293","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 1- Strategy communicated to public bodies|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Research, Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Education and skills|Follow-up mechanism: Periodic monitoring and/or evaluation of progress|Foresight exercise included: No|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: None specifically emphasised|Specific business sector(s) targeted: None specifically targeted|Strategy mainly prioritises: Specific areas/sectors (e.g. new industrial policy, R&D targets for clean tech)"
