To promote and develop IA enabling factors (i.e., human capital, technological infrastructure and data) which include, among others, advanced human capital, optic fiber networks, computational Infrastructure, large datasets.<br/>2. To strengthen and connect all the stakeholders involved in the development and usage of IA, promoting innovation in universities and firms, avoiding information asymmetries and contributing to a human-centered IA use in the State and industry.<br/>3. To discuss and reach consensus about ethics, standards, cybersecurity and regulation between the private and public sectors for a human-centered development and use of AI.The working plan has three phases:<br/>1. An interdisciplinary expert’s committee was appointed and announced on September by the Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation, which will develop a first draft of the AI Policy in 2019. <br/>2. The Policy Draft will be open for discussion by the civil society during January 2020.<br/>3. The Policy and an Action Plan, which will include concrete measures for the development of the policy, will be launched in April 2020.","Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation (Minscience;Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología, Conocimiento e Innovación)","","false","","Less than 1M","Chile","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers|Social groups especially emphasised","Academic societies / academies|Civil society|Established researchers|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Industry associations|Labour force in general|National government|PhD students|Postdocs and other early-career researchers|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Secondary education students|Teachers|Technology transfer offices|Undergraduate and master students","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24840/instrument/18485","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 1- Strategy communicated to public bodies|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Research, Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Education and skills, Governance|Follow-up mechanism: None|Foresight exercise included: Yes|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: Inclusiveness (e.g. inequality, job insecurity), Other|Specific business sector(s) targeted: None specifically targeted|Strategy mainly prioritises: STI policy governance (e.g. vertical and horizontal coordination, evaluation), Clusters and regional support (including regional/local R&D investments), Specific areas/sectors (e.g. new industrial policy, R&D targets for clean tech), Business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship, Access to finance for innovation (e.g. venture capital, business angels, financial markets), Skills for research and innovation, Stakeholder participation and consultation"
