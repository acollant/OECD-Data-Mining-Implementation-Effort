Lithuania – The innermost network consists of two central hubs: Vilnius and Kaunas. Regional cities constitute network nodes. This layer seeks to encourage the existing AI ecosystem and promote future growth. This could be done by supporting new AI applications, promote existing applications, and the sharing of knowledge (ex: AI meetups, conferences, online portal with a list of relevant companies).<br/>2. Global Lithuania – The second innermost network seeks to strengthen ties with AI experts in Lithuania’s diaspora. Global Lithuania is drawn out as a separate layer to highlight Lithuania’s relatively unique diaspora positioning (especially considering its history, size and activism in Lithuania). This layer seeks to identify AI experts in the diaspora, to create and maintain a registrar of diaspora AI expert’s contacts, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and competence. This transfer of knowledge and competence can occur indirectly (ex: highlighting success stories to build trust, attract new investors) and directly (ex: inviting individuals to participate as advisors on AI related committees).<br/>3. Baltic region – The third innermost network aims to develop and maintain relationships with Lithuania’s neighbors: Latvia and Estonia. This layer highlights the countries’ shared modern history and geopolitical situation. The network could be strengthened through pan-Baltic initiatives. Such initiatives could also help promote the region’s shared values on a global stage.<br/>4. Nordic-Baltic region – The first outermost network positions Lithuania with its extended neighbors. This network can similarly be strengthened through more shared initiatives and transfer of knowledge.<br/>5. European Union – The second outermost network identifies Lithuania within the European Union framework and legislation.<br/>6. Global – The third outermost network frames Lithuania within a global context. Lithuania seeks to take an active role in the global artificial intelligence community. This could include organizing an international AI conference, encouraging international companies to open initiatives (such as labs) in Lithuania, encouraging local AI experts to participate in international AI conferences, and so forth.","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 1- Strategy communicated to public bodies|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Other|Follow-up mechanism: None|Foresight exercise included: No|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: None specifically emphasised|Specific business sector(s) targeted: Agriculture, Energy, Automotive and road transportation, Health and healthcare, Other manufacturing|Strategy mainly prioritises: Specific areas/sectors (e.g. new industrial policy, R&D targets for clean tech), International cooperation on STI"
