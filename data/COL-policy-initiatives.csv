The Government expects this document to be officially published in October 2019.","2019","2022","","","To increase the generation of social and economic value through the digital transformation of the public sector and the private sector, through the reduction of barriers, the strengthening of human capital and the development of enabling conditions, so that Colombia can take advantage of opportunities and face challenges related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.1. Creating an AI Market: <br/>The objective of this policy is to create and develop the most dynamic and thriving AI market in Latin America, and one of the most important AI markets in the world. Colombia will become a laboratory for the creation of its own AI market where designers, suppliers, intermediaries and consumers of this technology can easily interact. This market will become the driving center for the 4IR emerging ecosystem and will keep Colombia in a highly competitive level. Therefore, the Government must build an environment that makes its investment climate more attractive to foreign and local entrepreneurs developing this technology. <br/><br/>2. Prioritize market-creating innovations: <br/>The Government will provide favorable conditions for the design and development of market-creating innovations based on AI systems. These creations are pivotal for the growth of an AI market in Colombia. They can also have a profound impact on the national economy by creating a new environment for business innovation. According to this guideline, the Government responds to the specific demands and changes required by the newborn innovation ecosystem and does not anticipate to them. Therefore, it makes an efficient and effective use of available resources, responding to real needs and not to hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, the Government wants private entrepreneurs to develop this kind of innovations. The Government considers that this is the precise moment for these entrepreneurs to move a step forward and lead the creation of an emerging technology market that has the potential to provide more wealth and opportunities to Colombia’s population. <br/><br/>3. Evidence-based policies and design of impact metrics: <br/>Regulation may put on risk the development of a competitive AI market in Colombia. Therefore, any regulation that has an impact on AI systems must be based on considerable evidence that supports the need for State intervention. Therefore, metrics and indicators should be developed to evaluate the impact of AI systems in society. Once the impact produced by AI systems implemented and deployed in Colombia is measured and defined, there will be proper evidence to design a smart regulatory framework for AI systems. Jointly, this approach will stimulate cost-benefit analysis in the design and implementation of policies and regulations regarding AI systems. <br/><br/>4. Regulatory experimentation: <br/>Considering the impact of regulation, Colombia should also adopt groundbreaking regulatory models for AI systems. Therefore, the Government will support the creation of regulatory sandboxes. Sandboxes allow Governmental Agencies to have access and understand AI systems being deployed in Colombia. Likewise, it allows entrepreneurs to experiment with this technology in a safe and controlled environment. However, the Government must go beyond sandboxes and should consider the design of regulatory beaches. These beaches can help Colombia to develop a complete space of experimentation that even covers entire sectors of the national economy. This model can have several effects, such as, (i) longer-lasting effects; (ii) contribute to the creation of the AI market; (iii) bring a more ambitious cultural change; and (iv) limit the State’s role to the supervision -not the creation- of private innovation. <br/><br/>5. Data infrastructure for AI: <br/>The Government will continue to develop a comprehensive data infrastructure that can be used to design and implement AI systems in Colombia. This is an essential measure required to build a competitive AI Market. The Government's objective is to facilitate data access for AI designers by removing unnecessary and unjustified barriers to have access to this information. Therefore, national Government must promote an ambitious data policy that will facilitate data access and sharing. One of the Government’s priorities is to promote data interoperability and increase the number of public datasets, especially those that contain structured data. Additionally, it is necessary to design models and methodologies that improve the data sharing between different organizations. It is essential that data can be easily shared with entities located in Colombia or abroad. Therefore, the Government will analyze the implementation of data sharing models such as Data Trusts or Data Commons, amongst others. Furthermore, the Government will continue to monitor and promote the implementation of the National Big Data Policy (CONPES document 3920), especially those strategies related to public data access and development of public data infrastructure. Following this principle, the Government will also set clear guidelines to enable cross-border flows of personal data and to facilitate the exchange of such data among different organizations. Colombian data protection regulation must protect citizens considering a risk-management approach.6. AI Market as a tool to achieve social equality and inclusion: <br/>AI systems can provide solutions to Colombia’s marginalized populations. Specific market conditions should be developed for AI to fulfill this purpose. The Government also wants to achieve this purpose by developing inclusive AI systems. One of the first strategies to achieve this goal is to promote the creation of an AI market for non-traditional consumers. Through this market, low-income consumers will also have access to AI solutions offered by entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>7. Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and safety: <br/>The Government acknowledges the ethical discussions and debates surrounding AI systems. There are several challenges that must be addressed. Personal data processing on AI systems and the design of “black box” systems are already controversial issues. This can lead to undesired outcomes, harming most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Jointly, these systems are vulnerable to security breaches which can be highly dangerous, even to physical infrastructure. Several organizations and governments agencies around the globe have proposed a series of ethical principles to protect citizens. Some of the principles proposed are fairness, transparency, non-discrimination, accountability, security and privacy, among others. <br/><br/>The Government of Colombia is aware of this situation and considers the need for ethical principles that guide AI systems design, implementation and deployment. Ethical principles must guide the experimentation ecosystem that is being developed in Colombia and the AI market proposed. For this task several principles must be consider, such as fairness, transparency, freedom, accountability, inclusion and the framework provided by human rights. Additionally, the use of specific tools must be analyzed and carefully consider for these principles to be materialized (e.g. auditing algorithms, code of ethics, etc.). These principles and tools must be designed and discussed with different organizations and sectors, especially with academia and private companies. <br/><br/>The objective of the Government is for the Colombian ethical framework for AI to be a product of consensus among diverse entities. Likewise, the principles proposed must be based on the evidence available around the world and that demonstrate real ethical risks in the design and implementation of AI systems. Therefore, these principles can change from time to time, considering the new evidence that is reported. The Government will track and monitor case studies and evidence that describe ethical challenges that must be addressed. Finally, it is essential to develop standards to address security issues directly related to AI systems (e.g. adversarial attacks). Those standards should help organizations designing or implementing AI systems to protect users, data integrity and digital systems architecture. <br/><br/>8. Credible commitments and consensus building: <br/>The Government of Colombia wants to design and implement a public policy on AI that is based on credible commitments. These commitments are essential to attract foreign investment and provide legal and regulatory certainty. Therefore, the government has developed a series of institutional reforms that provide credibility to this Strategy. Those reforms will be further described in this document. Jointly, the Government considers that credibility and trust are built if the policies proposed are the result of consensus among different sectors and entities. Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market. Therefore, education programs should provide spaces for policy-makers in education to experiment, learn and introduce rapid changes. Likewise, the Government will develop specific training programs for the workforce already active in the labor market. The Government will provide access to lifelong learning projects and platforms. Additionally, it will design and implement intensive training programs for individuals interacting with AI systems. <br/><br/>10. Strategic role of academic research in the development of an AI market: <br/>Colombia has to develop a plan for academic research on AI to be further developed at higher education institutions. This research should become an essential input to develop an AI market in Colombia. It is critical to implement strategies to support researchers working on AI and to facilitate their access to resources. Moreover, the Government wants to facilitate the interaction between academic research and private companies. The main objective is for academic research to play a more relevant role on the creation of corporate R&D and innovation areas in Colombia companies. This also requires a specific plan to disseminate and develop more knowledge, patents and scientific information in Colombia, specially the information and data that is relevant to design, develop and implement AI systems.11. Attract international talent and skilled labor: <br/>The Government should develop an AI market that attracts international talent and not only relies on Colombian’s expertise on this matter. Consequently, one of the priorities set forth by the Government is to design programs that allow AI experts from all over the world to see Colombia and its market as a possible destination. The goal is for Colombia to become a regional leader and an orchestrator of several AI projects. Building alliances with international organizations and academic institutions is central for the Government at this point. <br/><br/>12. Evidence-based policies on the future of labor: <br/><br/>The impact of AI on labor markets must be demystified. Therefore, it is necessary to collect evidence that allows the Government to define the real effects of this technology in Colombia’s labor market. Evidence-based policies are essential for Colombia to avoid implementing regulatory measures that can have disruptive effects on its innovation ecosystem. Without this precaution, there can be regulatory measures that may be unnecessary and have a negative impact on the AI Market and on Colombian workers. Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology. To achieve this purpose, Government agencies must consider AI systems in the design of their digital transformation projects. AI should be seen by public officials as a strategic tool that provides several solutions to the challenges of the public sector. AI can be very effective to increase State Capability in Colombia. The Government can use this technology to increase territorial control, improve policy implementation and enable a digital transformation process in public entities, amongst other projects. Therefore, the AI market should serve as a source of solutions for the public sector, where entrepreneurs provide effective and disruptive tools to improve public management. <br/><br/>14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy: <br/>This policy seeks to become one of the most relevant AI strategies in the world. This relevance in the international arena depends on the effective implementation of the measures described in this document. This requires the deployment of policy-tools to ensure its implementation and the sustainability of the actions proposed. The Government will put in place such measures, that should also demonstrate that these are credible commitments. Additionally, policy implementation is relevant to be effective on the policy evaluation process. <br/><br/>15. Continuous interaction with the international community and global experts: <br/>The Government of Colombia acknowledges the leadership exercised by some countries and institutions in the design, development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the Government considers that participating of global networks working on AI is central for this Strategy.","Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MINTIC;Ministerio de las Tecnologias de la Información y las Comunicaciones)","https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ%C3%B3micos/3975.pdf","false","","1M-5M","Colombia","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Social groups especially emphasised","Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Labour force in general|National government|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Subnational government","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/25007/instrument/18706","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 3- Strategy provides recommendations to public bodies which they have to adopt or reject via formal procedures|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Research, Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Education and skills, Governance|Follow-up mechanism: Action plan|Foresight exercise included: No|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: Inclusiveness (e.g. inequality, job insecurity)|Specific business sector(s) targeted: Telecommunications and IT|Strategy mainly prioritises: STI policy governance (e.g. vertical and horizontal coordination, evaluation), Technology transfers and commercialisation, Societal challenges (e.g. social inclusiveness), International cooperation on STI"

Finally, it is essential to develop standards to address security issues directly related to AI systems (e.g. adversarial attacks). Those standards should help organizations designing or implementing AI systems to protect users, data integrity and digital systems architecture. <br/><br/>8. Credible commitments and consensus building: <br/>The Government of Colombia wants to design and implement a public policy on AI that is based on credible commitments. These commitments are essential to attract foreign investment and provide legal and regulatory certainty. Therefore, the government has developed a series of institutional reforms that provide credibility to this Strategy. Those reforms will be further described in this document. Jointly, the Government considers that credibility and trust are built if the policies proposed are the result of consensus among different sectors and entities. Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market.

Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology. To achieve this purpose, Government agencies must consider AI systems in the design of their digital transformation projects.

Therefore, the AI market should serve as a source of solutions for the public sector, where entrepreneurs provide effective and disruptive tools to improve public management. <br/><br/>14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy: <br/>This policy seeks to become one of the most relevant AI strategies in the world. This relevance in the international arena depends on the effective implementation of the measures described in this document. This requires the deployment of policy-tools to ensure its implementation and the sustainability of the actions proposed. The Government will put in place such measures, that should also demonstrate that these are credible commitments. Additionally, policy implementation is relevant to be effective on the policy evaluation process. <br/><br/>15. Continuous interaction with the international community and global experts: <br/>The Government of Colombia acknowledges the leadership exercised by some countries and institutions in the design, development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the Government considers that participating of global networks working on AI is central for this Strategy.","Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MINTIC;Ministerio de las Tecnologias de la Información y las Comunicaciones)","https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ%C3%B3micos/3975.pdf","false","","1M-5M","Colombia","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Social groups especially emphasised","Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Labour force in general|National government|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Subnational government","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/25007/instrument/19793","Guidance, regulation and incentives","Emerging technology regulation","Regulatory Sandboxes","","","Approach to monitor compliance: Regulated parties are simply required to share compliance data (no regulator support)|Challenge(s) addressed: Unethical use (e.g. discrimination)|Level of governance: National|Regulatory approach: Technology or input-based regulation (e.g. moratoria, standards of use)|Role of government: Market regulator (e.g. antitrust law)|Type(s) of regulation: Regulatory experiments (e.g. sandboxes)"

The Government expects this document to be officially published in October 2019.","2019","2022","","","To increase the generation of social and economic value through the digital transformation of the public sector and the private sector, through the reduction of barriers, the strengthening of human capital and the development of enabling conditions, so that Colombia can take advantage of opportunities and face challenges related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.1. Creating an AI Market: <br/>The objective of this policy is to create and develop the most dynamic and thriving AI market in Latin America, and one of the most important AI markets in the world. Colombia will become a laboratory for the creation of its own AI market where designers, suppliers, intermediaries and consumers of this technology can easily interact. This market will become the driving center for the 4IR emerging ecosystem and will keep Colombia in a highly competitive level. Therefore, the Government must build an environment that makes its investment climate more attractive to foreign and local entrepreneurs developing this technology. <br/><br/>2. Prioritize market-creating innovations: <br/>The Government will provide favorable conditions for the design and development of market-creating innovations based on AI systems. These creations are pivotal for the growth of an AI market in Colombia. They can also have a profound impact on the national economy by creating a new environment for business innovation. According to this guideline, the Government responds to the specific demands and changes required by the newborn innovation ecosystem and does not anticipate to them. Therefore, it makes an efficient and effective use of available resources, responding to real needs and not to hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, the Government wants private entrepreneurs to develop this kind of innovations. The Government considers that this is the precise moment for these entrepreneurs to move a step forward and lead the creation of an emerging technology market that has the potential to provide more wealth and opportunities to Colombia’s population. <br/><br/>3. Evidence-based policies and design of impact metrics: <br/>Regulation may put on risk the development of a competitive AI market in Colombia. Therefore, any regulation that has an impact on AI systems must be based on considerable evidence that supports the need for State intervention. Therefore, metrics and indicators should be developed to evaluate the impact of AI systems in society. Once the impact produced by AI systems implemented and deployed in Colombia is measured and defined, there will be proper evidence to design a smart regulatory framework for AI systems. Jointly, this approach will stimulate cost-benefit analysis in the design and implementation of policies and regulations regarding AI systems. <br/><br/>4. Regulatory experimentation: <br/>Considering the impact of regulation, Colombia should also adopt groundbreaking regulatory models for AI systems. Therefore, the Government will support the creation of regulatory sandboxes. Sandboxes allow Governmental Agencies to have access and understand AI systems being deployed in Colombia. Likewise, it allows entrepreneurs to experiment with this technology in a safe and controlled environment. However, the Government must go beyond sandboxes and should consider the design of regulatory beaches. These beaches can help Colombia to develop a complete space of experimentation that even covers entire sectors of the national economy. This model can have several effects, such as, (i) longer-lasting effects; (ii) contribute to the creation of the AI market; (iii) bring a more ambitious cultural change; and (iv) limit the State’s role to the supervision -not the creation- of private innovation. <br/><br/>5. Data infrastructure for AI: <br/>The Government will continue to develop a comprehensive data infrastructure that can be used to design and implement AI systems in Colombia. This is an essential measure required to build a competitive AI Market. The Government's objective is to facilitate data access for AI designers by removing unnecessary and unjustified barriers to have access to this information. Therefore, national Government must promote an ambitious data policy that will facilitate data access and sharing. One of the Government’s priorities is to promote data interoperability and increase the number of public datasets, especially those that contain structured data. Additionally, it is necessary to design models and methodologies that improve the data sharing between different organizations. It is essential that data can be easily shared with entities located in Colombia or abroad. Therefore, the Government will analyze the implementation of data sharing models such as Data Trusts or Data Commons, amongst others. Furthermore, the Government will continue to monitor and promote the implementation of the National Big Data Policy (CONPES document 3920), especially those strategies related to public data access and development of public data infrastructure. Following this principle, the Government will also set clear guidelines to enable cross-border flows of personal data and to facilitate the exchange of such data among different organizations. Colombian data protection regulation must protect citizens considering a risk-management approach.6. AI Market as a tool to achieve social equality and inclusion: <br/>AI systems can provide solutions to Colombia’s marginalized populations. Specific market conditions should be developed for AI to fulfill this purpose. The Government also wants to achieve this purpose by developing inclusive AI systems. One of the first strategies to achieve this goal is to promote the creation of an AI market for non-traditional consumers. Through this market, low-income consumers will also have access to AI solutions offered by entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>7. Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and safety: <br/>The Government acknowledges the ethical discussions and debates surrounding AI systems. There are several challenges that must be addressed. Personal data processing on AI systems and the design of “black box” systems are already controversial issues. This can lead to undesired outcomes, harming most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Jointly, these systems are vulnerable to security breaches which can be highly dangerous, even to physical infrastructure. Several organizations and governments agencies around the globe have proposed a series of ethical principles to protect citizens. Some of the principles proposed are fairness, transparency, non-discrimination, accountability, security and privacy, among others. <br/><br/>The Government of Colombia is aware of this situation and considers the need for ethical principles that guide AI systems design, implementation and deployment. Ethical principles must guide the experimentation ecosystem that is being developed in Colombia and the AI market proposed. For this task several principles must be consider, such as fairness, transparency, freedom, accountability, inclusion and the framework provided by human rights. Additionally, the use of specific tools must be analyzed and carefully consider for these principles to be materialized (e.g. auditing algorithms, code of ethics, etc.). These principles and tools must be designed and discussed with different organizations and sectors, especially with academia and private companies. <br/><br/>The objective of the Government is for the Colombian ethical framework for AI to be a product of consensus among diverse entities. Likewise, the principles proposed must be based on the evidence available around the world and that demonstrate real ethical risks in the design and implementation of AI systems. Therefore, these principles can change from time to time, considering the new evidence that is reported. The Government will track and monitor case studies and evidence that describe ethical challenges that must be addressed. Finally, it is essential to develop standards to address security issues directly related to AI systems (e.g. adversarial attacks). Those standards should help organizations designing or implementing AI systems to protect users, data integrity and digital systems architecture. <br/><br/>8. Credible commitments and consensus building: <br/>The Government of Colombia wants to design and implement a public policy on AI that is based on credible commitments. These commitments are essential to attract foreign investment and provide legal and regulatory certainty. Therefore, the government has developed a series of institutional reforms that provide credibility to this Strategy. Those reforms will be further described in this document. Jointly, the Government considers that credibility and trust are built if the policies proposed are the result of consensus among different sectors and entities. Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market. Therefore, education programs should provide spaces for policy-makers in education to experiment, learn and introduce rapid changes. Likewise, the Government will develop specific training programs for the workforce already active in the labor market. The Government will provide access to lifelong learning projects and platforms. Additionally, it will design and implement intensive training programs for individuals interacting with AI systems. <br/><br/>10. Strategic role of academic research in the development of an AI market: <br/>Colombia has to develop a plan for academic research on AI to be further developed at higher education institutions. This research should become an essential input to develop an AI market in Colombia. It is critical to implement strategies to support researchers working on AI and to facilitate their access to resources. Moreover, the Government wants to facilitate the interaction between academic research and private companies. The main objective is for academic research to play a more relevant role on the creation of corporate R&D and innovation areas in Colombia companies. This also requires a specific plan to disseminate and develop more knowledge, patents and scientific information in Colombia, specially the information and data that is relevant to design, develop and implement AI systems.11. Attract international talent and skilled labor: <br/>The Government should develop an AI market that attracts international talent and not only relies on Colombian’s expertise on this matter. Consequently, one of the priorities set forth by the Government is to design programs that allow AI experts from all over the world to see Colombia and its market as a possible destination. The goal is for Colombia to become a regional leader and an orchestrator of several AI projects. Building alliances with international organizations and academic institutions is central for the Government at this point. <br/><br/>12. Evidence-based policies on the future of labor: <br/><br/>The impact of AI on labor markets must be demystified. Therefore, it is necessary to collect evidence that allows the Government to define the real effects of this technology in Colombia’s labor market. Evidence-based policies are essential for Colombia to avoid implementing regulatory measures that can have disruptive effects on its innovation ecosystem. Without this precaution, there can be regulatory measures that may be unnecessary and have a negative impact on the AI Market and on Colombian workers. Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology. To achieve this purpose, Government agencies must consider AI systems in the design of their digital transformation projects. AI should be seen by public officials as a strategic tool that provides several solutions to the challenges of the public sector. AI can be very effective to increase State Capability in Colombia. The Government can use this technology to increase territorial control, improve policy implementation and enable a digital transformation process in public entities, amongst other projects. Therefore, the AI market should serve as a source of solutions for the public sector, where entrepreneurs provide effective and disruptive tools to improve public management. <br/><br/>14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy: <br/>This policy seeks to become one of the most relevant AI strategies in the world. This relevance in the international arena depends on the effective implementation of the measures described in this document. This requires the deployment of policy-tools to ensure its implementation and the sustainability of the actions proposed. The Government will put in place such measures, that should also demonstrate that these are credible commitments. Additionally, policy implementation is relevant to be effective on the policy evaluation process. <br/><br/>15. Continuous interaction with the international community and global experts: <br/>The Government of Colombia acknowledges the leadership exercised by some countries and institutions in the design, development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the Government considers that participating of global networks working on AI is central for this Strategy.","Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MINTIC;Ministerio de las Tecnologias de la Información y las Comunicaciones)","https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ%C3%B3micos/3975.pdf","false","","1M-5M","Colombia","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Social groups especially emphasised","Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Labour force in general|National government|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Subnational government","NONE","","","","","",""
