The concept of “AI Networking” refers the situation that AI systems become connected. It also generated the concept of “Wisdom Network Society” as a desirable image of society to be built through the progress of AI Networking. The draft of AI R&D Guidelines were released as the result of the conference, which consists of 8 articles. The Final Report was released in 2016 and the draft of Guidelines were presented at the G7 ICT Ministers’ Meeting held in April 2016, in Takamatsu, Japan. The guidelines contributed to the G7 discussion and Ministers' statement, held in September 2017, in Turin, Italy.<br/>In 2017, the “Conference toward AI Network Society” was organized with about 33 participants (in 2019, about 50 participants). The members of the conference are from academia, industry, and civil society. They released their own report on July 2017, which consisted of the ""Draft AI R&D Guidelines"" with 9 principles for international discussions[1]. It also includes an impact assessment of AI network society, which is based on case study scenarios of mobility, education, healthcare, etc.<br/><br/>AI systems may change its output (or program itself) during the utilization through continuous learning from input data. There are not only matters that developers are expected to keep in mind, but also matters that users are expected to keep in mind in using AI. For this reason, the conference released their own report on July 2018, which consists of the ""Draft AI Utilization Principles"" with 10 principles[2] to which AI service providers, end users, and data providers are expected to pay attention.<br/><br/>The conference continued the discussion with respect to the measures to realize the principles and what steps each stakeholder should take for that purpose. The conference published their own report[3] in August 2019, which consists of the document, entitled ""AI Utilization Guidelines"". It is a commentary on principles expected to be taken into consideration in the utilization of AI for the promotion of the benefits of AI with risk mitigation, and based on the above ""Draft AI Utilization Principles"". <br/><br/>[1] http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000507517.pdf<br/>[2] http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000581310.pdf<br/>[3] http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000637844.pdf (Overview)","",""
