Thus, advances in Spanish language resources and technologies would improve the internationalization of the Spanish HLT industry in the Iber-American Market.<br/><br/>2- Industrial and Economic Perspective:<br/>- HLT sector is growing rapidly in the large multinationals. However, support is needed for the innovative start-ups, spin-off and SMEs in the sector given the role they can play in the national economy. Thus, Plan TL considers this line as one of its principal actions.<br/><br/>3- Legal Perspective:<br/>Building large Language Resources is highly benefiting from legislations concerning Open Public Data. However, on the other hand, building resources should respect the Data Protection such as the GDPR. <br/>In the last two years, main changes direclty affected the action lines of the Language Techonology Plans:<br/>1. Artificial Intelligence Strategies: At the international, EU and national levels, a number of Artificial Intelligence Strategies were published. Given the role of HLT as an indispensable component of AI, the Language Technologies Plan (Plan TL) had to join efforts with these efforts and initiatives towards AI strategies.<br/>2. Connecting Europe Facilities Programme and the participation of the Plan TL in different projects funded by CEF contributed in going further steps towards applying results of research and academic in offering services on a wider scale. Moreover, it helped creating more synergies with other EU stakeholders.<br/>3. Initiatives on Open Science such as the European Science Cloud Initiatives were in the core of one of the Flagship Projects concerning R&D&I Policy Making where HLT are introduced to landscape the RDI space in patents, publications, projects, grants, etc.<br/>4. European initiatives for Interoperability in Public Administration also had an impact on the action lines of the Plan TL since interoperable datasets and components are crucial for the advancement of the HLT industry and the Public Services.<br/>5. SuperComputing and High Performance Computers are also changing the panorama in the last two years. Plan TL contemplated the integration of HPC in its action lines, especially for the deployment of NLP platforms and for applying deep learning techniques to calculate language models over large datasets.","To foster the development of the Human Language Technologies sector in Spain, and to take advantage of these novel capabilities to improve and innovate public services. <br/><br/>Human Language Tecnologies include 5 cross-cutting technical lines: <br/>1. Natural Language Processing <br/>2. Machine Translation<br/>3. Speech Processing and Dialogue Sistems <br/>4. Language Resources <br/>5. Machine and Deep Learning Models and Algorithms.Four Specific Objectives represent the structure of Plan TL:<br/>i. Development of linguistic infrastuctures in Spanish and co-oficial languages (Catalan, Basque and Galician) in terms of language resources and processing platforms. Language resources include large corpora, i.e. datasets, of textual, spoken or multimodal data. Processing platforms include processing components and pipelines.Technical and Semantic interoperability are in the centre of these resources.ii. Promoting HLT Industry by supporting the following actions:<br/>- Enhancing the visibility of the Spanish HLT industry and the products and services they offer. This visibility contemplates both the national and the European levels as innovative technologies and enables for the European Digital Single Market.<br/>- Encouraging knowledge transfer from academia to industry in the sector.<br/>- Supporting SMEs and innovative start-ups.<br/>- Improving the internationalization of the Spanish HLT captitalizing on the high potential of Spanish in the Ibero-American market.iii. Public Administrations as drivers of the language industry. This line contemplates two main roles of Public Administrations as: <br/>a) Data-Providers for Language Resources capitalizing on the principles of ""Open Public Data"" as valuable sources for developing linguistic infrastuctures. Access and use of these datasets is possible within legislative frameworks such as the European Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information, also known as the ‘Open Data Directive’ (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) or other national legislations.<br/>b) Users by introducing HLT within their workflows and, thus, to improve the quality, efficiency and capacity of the public services offered to the citizen. There are two main types of users: The Policy/Decision Maker and the Civil Servant implementing the different processes. The capacity of HLT to process large volumes of data in different formats are highly useful for data-driven and knowledge-based policy making. On the other hand, introducing HLT in some processes of the daily work of the Civil Servant could make some action more efficient by saving time and effort.<br/>Finally, citizens are considered as an indirect beneficiary of such innovation in public services.iv. Flagship Projects:<br/>These are domain specific projects aiming at applying HLT in specific public services with high social impact such as Health, Justice, R&D&I Policy Making, Cultural Heritage, etc. The scope of these flagship projects encompass the entire value chain to end up with ready products and services.","Secretary of State for Digital Agenda (SESIAD;Secretaría de Estado - Sociedad de la Información y Agenda Digital)","https://www.plantl.gob.es/tecnologias-lenguaje/PTL/Bibliotecaimpulsotecnologiaslenguaje/Detalle%20del%20Plan/Plan-Impulso-Tecnologias-Lenguaje.pdf","false","","50M-100M","Spain","Emerging trends in STI policy|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Digital transformation of firms","|Firms by age|Governmental entities","Firms of any age|National government|Social groups especially emphasised|Subnational government","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/16665/instrument/13231","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 4- Strategy dictates public bodies' activities or budgets|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Research, Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Governance|Follow-up mechanism: None|Foresight exercise included: Yes|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: None specifically emphasised|Specific business sector(s) targeted: Telecommunications and IT|Strategy mainly prioritises: Business innovation and innovative entrepreneurship, Technology transfers and commercialisation"
