It was created by a task force for the Agency for Digital Italy. In late 2018, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico; hereafter: MISE) selected a multi-stakeholder task force of national experts in the field of AI, with the intention of promoting a participatory process of policy design. Its 30 members were chosen upon a public call, in a view of ensuring a balanced representation of voices from the academia, the business community, and civil society players (incl. unions and consumer associations).<br/>The task force concluded its work in June 2019, by formulating a package of 82 policy recommendations. The recommendations touch basically all policy areas outlined in the European Coordinated Plan on AI: from technology transfer and adoption to testing facilities, from education to up- and re-skilling of labour force, as well as ethical compliance and consumer protection.","","Method: Focus groups, Expert groups|Number of participants: 25 to 100|Stakeholders contribute to: Policy design"

The design and implementation phases of the Program interventions will take place through the involvement, at various levels, of public administrations, with ""5G environments"" being tested. <br/><br/>The Program is divided into two parts of intervention: <br/><br/>Part 1 – Houses of emerging technologies. All municipalities conducting a 5G trial during the course of the intervention can present projects for the emerging technology houses, meaning centers aimed at supporting research projects and experimentations, supporting the creation of startups and the technological transfer to SMEs on projects concerning the use of the Blockchain, of the IoT of Artificial Intelligence. A 40 Mln € is destined to the realization of the Houses.<br/><br/>Part 2 - Research and development projects. Public administrations, and in particular public Bodies, Agencies, Research Bodies, and Universities, will be able to apply for specific experimental research projects -- applied to emerging technologies and related to the development of new generation networks. The projects, aimed at improving services through the adoption of these technologies, must be carried out through the aggregation of several subjects, among which the leader of the aggregation must be identified, with the mandatory participation of at least one public research institution or University, and in collaboration with the operators holding usable frequencies for 5G. The projects subject to funding in this area must have characteristics of sustainability and repeatability on the national territory. The second part of the program will have a financial allocation of up to € 5 million, is intended for co-financing, up to a maximum of 80% of the investment, and a maximum of three projects will be developed at the national level.","Ministry of Economic Development (MISE;Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico)","https://www.mise.gov.it/images/stories/documenti/DM%2026%20marzo%202019%20GURI%20n.%20100-2019.pdf ; https://www.mise.gov.it/images/stories/documenti/Programma%20supporto%20tecnologie%20emergenti%205G.pdf","false","","20M-50M","Italy","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)","Governmental entities|Research and education organisations","Higher education institutes|Subnational government","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24914/instrument/18670","Guidance, regulation and incentives","Science and innovation challenges, prizes and awards","","","",""
