It also has the provisions to establish National and Regional DNA Data Banks for the maintenance of the national forensic DNA database for the purposes of identification of the aforementioned category of persons. This will aid in scientific up-gradation and streamlining of the DNA testing activities in the country. The Bill is under consideration by the Government.","The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill - 2019”, has been formulated for establishing identity of missing persons, victims, offenders, under trials and unknown deceased personThe bill envisages that every data bank will maintain indices like the crime scene index, suspects' or undertrials' index, offenders' index, missing persons' index and unknown deceased persons' index. The legislation also seeks to establish a DNA Regulatory Board. Every laboratory that analyses DNA samples to establish the identity of an individual, has to be accredited by the board. Under the bill, a written consent by individuals is required to collect DNA samples from them. Consent is not required for offences with punishment of more than seven years of imprisonment or death.It also provides for removal of DNA profiles of suspects on filing of a police report or court order, and of undertrials on the basis of a court order. Profiles in the crime scene and missing persons' index will be removed on a written request.","DBT (DBT;DBT)","http://www.dbtindia.gov.in/regulations-guidelines/regulations/dna-profiling-bill","true","","5M-20M","India","Emerging trends in STI policy","Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by size|Research and education organisations","Entrepreneurs|Large firms|Micro-enterprises|Multinational enterprises|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|SMEs","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24950/instrument/18608","Governance","Regulatory oversight and ethical advice bodies","The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill - 2019","","","Activities: Monitor compliance|Challenge(s) addressed: Privacy protection, Unethical use (e.g. dual-use technologies), Security (e.g. discrimination)|Reports are publicly available: Yes|Reports to: Head of national government|The coordination body is composed of: Mostly government representatives, A technical secretariat (e.g. policy analysts)|Type(s) of oversight or advice: Ethical principles (e.g. integrity, accountability, impartiality), Regulations"

Role of the Government has been clearly delineated to develop the research ecosystem, promote adoption and address skilling challenges. The strategy also flags important issues like ethics, bias and privacy issues relating to AI and envisions Government promoting research in technology to address these concerns. The focus is on sectors like agriculture, health and education where public investment and lead would be necessary.","In pursuance of the AI policy, NITI Aayog has adopted a three-pronged approach – undertaking exploratory proof-of-concept AI projects in various areas, crafting a national strategy for building a vibrant AI ecosystem in India and collaborating with various experts and stakeholders. Since the start of the year 2018, NITI Aayog has partnered with several leading AI technology players to implement AI projects in critical areas such as agriculture and health.","NITI Ayog (NITI Ayog;NITI Ayog)","https://niti.gov.in/national-strategy-artificial-intelligence","true","","20M-50M","India","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers","Entrepreneurs|Established researchers|Industry associations|Large firms|Micro-enterprises|Multinational enterprises|National government|Private investors|Public research institutes|SMEs","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24951/instrument/18609","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","National Strategy On Artificial Intelligence","","","Degree of coordination in implementing strategy (select the highest that applies): 3- Strategy provides recommendations to public bodies which they have to adopt or reject via formal procedures|Focuses on the following area(s) of the national innovation system: Business (innovation and/or entrepreneurship), Education and skills, Governance|Follow-up mechanism: Linked to new law or regulation, Periodic monitoring and/or evaluation of progress|Foresight exercise included: Yes|Societal challenge(s) emphasised: Health, Inclusiveness (e.g. inequality, job insecurity), Food security|Specific business sector(s) targeted: Energy, Pharmaceuticals, Health and healthcare|Strategy mainly prioritises: Public research capabilities, Digitalisation, Skills for research and innovation, Technology transfers and commercialisation, Societal challenges (e.g. social inclusiveness), Stakeholder participation and consultation"

These data are generated in the context of furthering knowledge, gaining deeper insights into biological and other processes and for translation. Ultimately, all data are to be used for the benefit of humankind; that is the major reason for investment of public funds to generate data. Sharing of data maximizes the collective utility of data.<br/>However, there are many issues that must be taken into account in the context of datasharing, the most important of which is that data-sharing must be done in a responsible manner. Data may induce vulnerability to individuals and to populations. The rights to privacy and confidentiality of individuals and populations must be protected as emphasized in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and no harm must be done to them as a result of data-sharing.<br/>This document provides a framework and principles for sharing of data while protecting the rights of individuals and populations and without causing any harm to them.","To define guidelines for sharing of data generated by scientists in India using modern<br/>biotechnological tools and methods.<br/>Although, this document provides broad guidelines for biological data in general, it<br/>specifically pertains to modern high-throughput, high-volume data, for example, data<br/>generated by nucleic acid sequencing and microarrays, biomolecular structures and flow<br/>cytometry.","DBT (DBT;DBT)","http://dbtindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/Draft1-Biological_Data_Policy.pdf","true","","20M-50M","India","Emerging trends in STI policy","Ethics of emerging technologies","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations","Entrepreneurs|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|National government|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Technology transfer offices","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24954/instrument/18611","Governance","Regulatory oversight and ethical advice bodies","Biological data storage, access and sharing policy of India 2019","","","Activities: Provide guidance, advice and support to stakeholders|Challenge(s) addressed: Privacy protection, Unethical use (e.g. dual-use technologies), Limited competition (e.g. monopolies, oligopolies)|Reports are publicly available: Yes|Reports to: Ministry|The coordination body is composed of: Mostly government representatives|Type(s) of oversight or advice: Guidelines"
