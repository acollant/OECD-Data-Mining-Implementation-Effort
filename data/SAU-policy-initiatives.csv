It is also encouraging early adoption of AI concepts and solutions through several smart city projects to catalyse new solutions. These build on the momentum of NEOM, a smart city megaproject launched in 2017 that invests a significant SAR 1.8 trillion (USD 500 billion). Saudi Arabia is also actively involved in global discussions on AI governance frameworks.","","","https://vision2030.gov.sa/en","false","","","Saudi Arabia","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)","Firms by size|Governmental entities|Social groups especially emphasised","Civil society|Firms of any size|National government","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/26017/instrument/22325","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","","",""
