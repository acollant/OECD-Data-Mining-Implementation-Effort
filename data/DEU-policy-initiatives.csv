Industry now stands at the threshold of a fourth industrial revolution. Via the evolution of internet, the real world and the virtual world are increasingly converging, to form an “Internet of Things”. The key characteristics of the industrial production of the future will include production of extensively individualised products, within highly flexible production environments; early-stage integration of customers and business partners within design and value-creation processes; and linking of production and high-quality services, to yield “hybrid products”. <br/><br/>“Industrie 4.0” started as one of the forward-looking projects under the previous High-Tech strategy in 2011. In 2013, the first platform “Industrie 4.0” was implemented by associations (BITKOM, VDMA, ZVEI) with support and engagement of the Federal Government, especially Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy as well as Federal Ministry of Education and Research. In 2015, the new “Plattform Industrie 4.0” was launched with support and engagement of the Federal Government, especially Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy as well as Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The stakeholders engaged in the platform strive for developing common recommendations for future actions which shall serve as common and reliable framework conditions. e.g. concerning standardization, security of networked systems, digital business models or future skills and competencies. In the platform, more than 350 national experts, e.g. from businesses, science community, politics as well as work councils and trade unions are active. The platform also serves as a unique communication channel to the public and closely cooperates with regional and local multipliers to spread Industry 4.0 to the German regions.<br/><br/>Services for SMEs: The platform’s members raise awareness for Industry 4.0 among companies – particularly small and medium-sized ones – and encourage and help these companies to put Industry 4.0 applications into practice. Therefore a Transfer Network was established in 2017.<br/><br/>Standardisation: The Plattform Industrie 4.0 stakeholders have developed the RAMI 4.0 reference architecture model. RAMI 4.0 is a three-dimensional coordinate system that displays the complex interactions of Industry 4.0, namely IT, lifecycle and automation hierarchy. In order to promote standardisation on an international level, the Standardization Council for Industry 4.0 was founded.","To organise stakeholders' contributions from enterprises, employees organisations and policy around the transition to the digital economy.To find answers on the questions of the digitization of the industry through dialogue. Together, companies and their employees, trade unions, associations, science and politics want to make a big impact.To develop joint recommendations for all stakeholders, that serve as the basis for a consistent and reliable framework. The platform will initiate alliances and networks at the pre-competitive stage which support the evolution of the entrepreneurial skills and energy present in Germany.To identify all relevant trends and developments in the manufacturing sector and to combine them to produce a common overall understanding of Industry 4.0. This means conversely that the platform does not operationally realise activities in the market, such as demonstration centres, research projects or company-led projects.To identify where action is required on standards and norms and should actively express recommendations for national and international committee work.","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF;Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung)|Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi;Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie)","http://www.plattform-i40.de","false","","1M-5M","Germany","Emerging trends in STI policy|Governance|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Cluster policies|Digital transformation of firms|Non-financial support to business R&D and innovation|Strategic policy intelligence","Economic actors (individuals)|Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers|Social groups especially emphasised","Academic societies / academies|Civil society|Entrepreneurs|Established researchers|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Industry associations|International entity|Labour force in general|National government|PhD students|Postdocs and other early-career researchers|Private investors|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Subnational government|Teachers|Technology transfer offices","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/4577/instrument/10300","Collaborative infrastructures (soft and physical)","Networking and collaborative platforms","","","","Exchanges take place via: Online platform, Meetings and events, Other|Focus: Business innovation-oriented, Technology-oriented, Building international linkages, Other|Objective(s): Promote economic growth (e.g. productivity, competitiveness), Promote business partnerships (e.g. consortia-building), Define research priorities, Share R&D data, Set standards, Demonstrate technological developments and innovations, Other|Ownership of IP stemming from science-industry research: Not applicable|Share of the platform's funding coming from the private sector (as a % of total funding): 0%"
