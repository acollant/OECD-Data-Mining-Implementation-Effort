It is a first step towards initiating concrete measures to achieve the intended acceleration and national profiling. To achieve its goals, the government cooperates with the Dutch AI Coalition. Here, companies, government agencies, knowledge institutions and educational institutions will work together to implement new AI actions that help the specific domains and sectors.","2019","","","Artificial intelligence (AI) is radically changing the world. AI will make a substantial contribution to the economic growth, prosperity and well-being of the Netherlands. It will also be of huge importance in solving societal issues, such as the ageing of the Dutch population, climate change, food safety, and health care. At the same time, we must not close our eyes to challenges such as the protection of fundamental rights as privacy, non-discrimination and autonomy.<br/>If the Netherlands and Europe want to be at the forefront of a globally competitive economy, we must accelerate the development and application of AI in the Netherlands. We can do so. The Netherlands is in an excellent position to take on this challenge, partly due to its high-quality connectivity, strong foundation for public–private partnerships (PPP) and world-class research. We must make good use of this strong starting position and develop it further so that the Netherlands can profile itself internationally.<br/>The government focuses on three tracks. Track 1 is that we must seize the societal and economic opportunities. This goal requires intensive PPPs, which will enable the Netherlands to stand out on the European playing field and in global markets. It will be companies, from start-ups and scale-ups to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations, that will make the difference in terms of innovation and competitiveness. They will determine whether the Netherlands will lead the way in AI or whether it follows other countries in this area. They also determine whether AI applications will add value to the economy and society. This added value can result from responding to societal challenges, or from quickly responding to the demands of the market. As a result, the government is developing this track in public private partnership, particularly with the Dutch AI Coalition, while calling on companies and organisations to join the coalition.<br/>Track 2 intends to put in their place the required conditions for a fruitful AI climate for economy and society. These conditions include the necessary knowledge, skills and training; top-quality scientific AI research, as well as applied research the results of which are useful to businesses and professionals. They also include access to usable data as well as high-quality and smart connectivity. In this context, we are investing in research programmes and training, increasing access to innovation funding for start-ups, promoting data-sharing, and further developing digital connectivity with and for AI.<br/>Track 3 is about ""Strengthening the foundations"". This track concerns the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights, as well as appropriate legal and ethical frameworks. As a result, people and companies can feel confident that AI will be used responsibly. It is also important that markets remain open and competitive, and that with all AI developments national security is safeguarded. To this end, necessary legislation and regulations are already in force or in the making. In addition, the government monitors AI developments and continues to stimulate the use of (European) ethical guidelines for AI applications by companies as well as public organisations.","To capitalise on societal and economic opportunities: policies encouraging the adoption, use and development of AI in the private and public sector and promoting the use of AI to tackle societal challenges.To create the right conditions: policies supporting education and skills development in AI; fostering research and innovation in AI, facilitating the access to qualitative data and improving the digital infrastructure;To strenghten the foundations: including policy actions related to ethical issues, such as trust, human rights, consumer protection, and safety of citizens.","Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK;Ministerie van Economische Zaken en Klimaat)|Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK;Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties)|Ministry of Justice and Security (JenV;Ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid)|Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW;Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap)","https://www.government.nl/documents/reports/2019/10/09/strategic-action-plan-for-artificial-intelligence","false","","50M-100M","Netherlands","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)","Firms by age|Firms by size|Governmental entities|Intermediaries|Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers","Academic societies / academies|Established researchers|Firms of any age|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Incubators, accelerators, science parks or technoparks|Industry associations|National government|PhD students|Postdocs and other early-career researchers|Secondary education students|SMEs|Subnational government|Teachers|Technology transfer offices|Undergraduate and master students","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/25502/instrument/19433","Governance","National strategies, agendas and plans","","As per funding, the Dutch version of the strategy mentions in annex that the yearly governmental budget to AI innovation and research is estimated at EUR 45 million.
