In particular, an AI call (“Team Up”) aimed at fostering collaboration between academia and industry was launched in 2017. This program reflects the Brussels Region approach to AI development, which emphasises collaborative research and open innovation. Academics gain access to real-world use cases and data while companies receive the expertise that they often lack. This scheme has been a resounding success with nineteen collaborative projects receiving a total of EUR 12M in subsidies. <br/>To complement this industrially-focused approach, AI was also chosen in 2018 as the topic of another R&I program called “Anticipate”. The objective was to fund projects which present a prospective vision of AI and of its future social and economic impact in the Region. This type of program provides key insight on the wide-ranging ethical, social, and economic implications of AI, which further enables the design of an inclusive and ethical AI strategy. <br/>While these past calls adopted a cross-sectorial approach, Innoviris is now increasingly shifting to more specialized calls, with for example an ongoing call dedicated to predictive medicine and an upcoming call dedicated to Industry 4.0.<br/>Besides these more targeted calls, Innoviris grants, through its open call dedicated to companies, more than EUR 6M in subsidies per year to AI/Data related projects.

In particular, an AI call (“Team Up”) aimed at fostering collaboration between academia and industry was launched in 2017. This program reflects the Brussels Region approach to AI development, which emphasises collaborative research and open innovation. Academics gain access to real-world use cases and data while companies receive the expertise that they often lack. This scheme has been a resounding success with nineteen collaborative projects receiving a total of EUR 12M in subsidies. <br/>To complement this industrially-focused approach, AI was also chosen in 2018 as the topic of another R&I program called “Anticipate”. The objective was to fund projects which present a prospective vision of AI and of its future social and economic impact in the Region. This type of program provides key insight on the wide-ranging ethical, social, and economic implications of AI, which further enables the design of an inclusive and ethical AI strategy. <br/>While these past calls adopted a cross-sectorial approach, Innoviris is now increasingly shifting to more specialized calls, with for example an ongoing call dedicated to predictive medicine and an upcoming call dedicated to Industry 4.0.<br/>Besides these more targeted calls, Innoviris grants, through its open call dedicated to companies, more than EUR 6M in subsidies per year to AI/Data related projects.

Belgium's approach is user-centric and data-centric. Therefore it places a strong emphasis on the alignment of new technological capabilities on our strategy, missions and values.<br/>Nevertheless, the FWB wishes to take full advantage of the AI’s potential in order to integrate it in the conduct of its missions to provide a better service to the citizens. It will proceed along two complementary lines. On the one hand, it is a question of carrying out transversal experiments on AI and assessing its potential (approaches to techniques, innovative working methods, business transformation, internal and external benefits for public action, etc.). On the other hand, it is a question of analysing the contributions of the AI for specific fields (education, culture, sports, etc.) and seeing the strengths and weaknesses of this new technological integration. For example, AI in education can be used as a way to make learning more appealing for students, support existing capabilities and cognitive development and enhance students’ creativity and performance in advance tasks. Moreover, AI can offer a more personalised and inclusive learning approach via intelligent tutoring systems or for example with tackling learning difficulties. It is for this set of points that the FWB wishes to develop, analyse and implement projects and reflections on artificial intelligence.<br/>Finally, the FWB works on the analysis of ethical aspects and the uses of data in the use of artificial intelligence in public services. The FWB has assigned a digital ethics coordinator and plan to set up an ethics board.","Walloon Brussels Federation (;Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles)","","false","","1M-5M","Belgium - Federal government","Emerging trends in STI policy","Artificial intelligence (AI)","Research and education organisations|Researchers, students and teachers","Higher education institutes|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes|Undergraduate and master students","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/24911/instrument/18559","Governance","Policy intelligence (e.g. evaluations, benchmarking and forecasts)","","","","Provides input to: Policy implementation|Study performed by: Public administration|Type of information: Technology assessments"

At the moment, such a framework is being operationalized. It intends to induce beneficiaries to undertake R&I projects ""ethical by design"". Practically this concerns compliance with the codes of ethics in research and development and with the prevailing (legally binding) ethical frameworks. Today, a considerable number of existing research protocols and legal frameworks are either not, only partially, or incorrectly applied. Besides the importance of respecting more familiar frameworks such as GDPR in research in the field of AI and data, the emphasis is broader. As well RDI projects that touch other ethically sensitive domains are concerned, such as projects based on human embryos, fetuses and tissues, with the involvement of precarious groups, animals, third world countries, and projects where possible adverse environmental effects or safety and health risks may emerge. Rather than penalising, the framework focuses primarily on empowerment.","the ethical guidelines will ensure an ""ethical by design"" approach, in the way Innoviris prepares its R&D calls.","Innoviris (Innoviris;Innoviris)","","false","","Not applicable","Belgium - Brussels Capital","Emerging trends in STI policy|Public research system|Research and innovation for society","Ethics of emerging technologies|Multi-stakeholder engagement|Research integrity and reproducibility","Firms by size|Research and education organisations|Social groups especially emphasised","Civil society|Firms of any size|Higher education institutes|Private research and development lab|Public research institutes","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/25363/instrument/19113","Governance","Policy intelligence (e.g. evaluations, benchmarking and forecasts)","ethical guidelines","","","Provides input to: Policy assessment|Study performed by: Public research institute|Type of information: Roadmaps"
