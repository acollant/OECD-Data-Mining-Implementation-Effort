On the other hand, it is a question of analysing the contributions of the AI for specific fields (education, culture, sports, etc.) and seeing the strengths and weaknesses of this new technological integration. For example, AI in education can be used as a way to make learning more appealing for students, support existing capabilities and cognitive development and enhance students’ creativity and performance in advance tasks.

Creating an AI Market: <br/>The objective of this policy is to create and develop the most dynamic and thriving AI market in Latin America, and one of the most important AI markets in the world. Colombia will become a laboratory for the creation of its own AI market where designers, suppliers, intermediaries and consumers of this technology can easily interact. This market will become the driving center for the 4IR emerging ecosystem and will keep Colombia in a highly competitive level. Therefore, the Government must build an environment that makes its investment climate more attractive to foreign and local entrepreneurs developing this technology. <br/><br/>2. Prioritize market-creating innovations: <br/>The Government will provide favorable conditions for the design and development of market-creating innovations based on AI systems. These creations are pivotal for the growth of an AI market in Colombia. They can also have a profound impact on the national economy by creating a new environment for business innovation. According to this guideline, the Government responds to the specific demands and changes required by the newborn innovation ecosystem and does not anticipate to them. Therefore, it makes an efficient and effective use of available resources, responding to real needs and not to hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, the Government wants private entrepreneurs to develop this kind of innovations. The Government considers that this is the precise moment for these entrepreneurs to move a step forward and lead the creation of an emerging technology market that has the potential to provide more wealth and opportunities to Colombia’s population. <br/><br/>3. Evidence-based policies and design of impact metrics: <br/>Regulation may put on risk the development of a competitive AI market in Colombia. Therefore, any regulation that has an impact on AI systems must be based on considerable evidence that supports the need for State intervention. Therefore, metrics and indicators should be developed to evaluate the impact of AI systems in society. Once the impact produced by AI systems implemented and deployed in Colombia is measured and defined, there will be proper evidence to design a smart regulatory framework for AI systems. Jointly, this approach will stimulate cost-benefit analysis in the design and implementation of policies and regulations regarding AI systems. <br/><br/>4. Regulatory experimentation: <br/>Considering the impact of regulation, Colombia should also adopt groundbreaking regulatory models for AI systems. Therefore, the Government will support the creation of regulatory sandboxes. Sandboxes allow Governmental Agencies to have access and understand AI systems being deployed in Colombia. Likewise, it allows entrepreneurs to experiment with this technology in a safe and controlled environment. However, the Government must go beyond sandboxes and should consider the design of regulatory beaches. These beaches can help Colombia to develop a complete space of experimentation that even covers entire sectors of the national economy. This model can have several effects, such as, (i) longer-lasting effects; (ii) contribute to the creation of the AI market; (iii) bring a more ambitious cultural change; and (iv) limit the State’s role to the supervision -not the creation- of private innovation. <br/><br/>5. Data infrastructure for AI: <br/>The Government will continue to develop a comprehensive data infrastructure that can be used to design and implement AI systems in Colombia. This is an essential measure required to build a competitive AI Market. The Government's objective is to facilitate data access for AI designers by removing unnecessary and unjustified barriers to have access to this information. Therefore, national Government must promote an ambitious data policy that will facilitate data access and sharing. One of the Government’s priorities is to promote data interoperability and increase the number of public datasets, especially those that contain structured data. Additionally, it is necessary to design models and methodologies that improve the data sharing between different organizations. It is essential that data can be easily shared with entities located in Colombia or abroad. Therefore, the Government will analyze the implementation of data sharing models such as Data Trusts or Data Commons, amongst others. Furthermore, the Government will continue to monitor and promote the implementation of the National Big Data Policy (CONPES document 3920), especially those strategies related to public data access and development of public data infrastructure. Following this principle, the Government will also set clear guidelines to enable cross-border flows of personal data and to facilitate the exchange of such data among different organizations. Colombian data protection regulation must protect citizens considering a risk-management approach.6. AI Market as a tool to achieve social equality and inclusion: <br/>AI systems can provide solutions to Colombia’s marginalized populations. Specific market conditions should be developed for AI to fulfill this purpose. The Government also wants to achieve this purpose by developing inclusive AI systems. One of the first strategies to achieve this goal is to promote the creation of an AI market for non-traditional consumers. Through this market, low-income consumers will also have access to AI solutions offered by entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>7. Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and safety: <br/>The Government acknowledges the ethical discussions and debates surrounding AI systems. There are several challenges that must be addressed. Personal data processing on AI systems and the design of “black box” systems are already controversial issues. This can lead to undesired outcomes, harming most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Jointly, these systems are vulnerable to security breaches which can be highly dangerous, even to physical infrastructure. Several organizations and governments agencies around the globe have proposed a series of ethical principles to protect citizens. Some of the principles proposed are fairness, transparency, non-discrimination, accountability, security and privacy, among others. <br/><br/>The Government of Colombia is aware of this situation and considers the need for ethical principles that guide AI systems design, implementation and deployment. Ethical principles must guide the experimentation ecosystem that is being developed in Colombia and the AI market proposed. For this task several principles must be consider, such as fairness, transparency, freedom, accountability, inclusion and the framework provided by human rights. Additionally, the use of specific tools must be analyzed and carefully consider for these principles to be materialized (e.g. auditing algorithms, code of ethics, etc.). These principles and tools must be designed and discussed with different organizations and sectors, especially with academia and private companies. <br/><br/>The objective of the Government is for the Colombian ethical framework for AI to be a product of consensus among diverse entities. Likewise, the principles proposed must be based on the evidence available around the world and that demonstrate real ethical risks in the design and implementation of AI systems. Therefore, these principles can change from time to time, considering the new evidence that is reported. The Government will track and monitor case studies and evidence that describe ethical challenges that must be addressed. Finally, it is essential to develop standards to address security issues directly related to AI systems (e.g. adversarial attacks). Those standards should help organizations designing or implementing AI systems to protect users, data integrity and digital systems architecture. <br/><br/>8. Credible commitments and consensus building: <br/>The Government of Colombia wants to design and implement a public policy on AI that is based on credible commitments. These commitments are essential to attract foreign investment and provide legal and regulatory certainty. Therefore, the government has developed a series of institutional reforms that provide credibility to this Strategy. Those reforms will be further described in this document. Jointly, the Government considers that credibility and trust are built if the policies proposed are the result of consensus among different sectors and entities. Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market. Therefore, education programs should provide spaces for policy-makers in education to experiment, learn and introduce rapid changes. Likewise, the Government will develop specific training programs for the workforce already active in the labor market. The Government will provide access to lifelong learning projects and platforms. Additionally, it will design and implement intensive training programs for individuals interacting with AI systems. <br/><br/>10. Strategic role of academic research in the development of an AI market: <br/>Colombia has to develop a plan for academic research on AI to be further developed at higher education institutions. This research should become an essential input to develop an AI market in Colombia. It is critical to implement strategies to support researchers working on AI and to facilitate their access to resources. Moreover, the Government wants to facilitate the interaction between academic research and private companies. The main objective is for academic research to play a more relevant role on the creation of corporate R&D and innovation areas in Colombia companies. This also requires a specific plan to disseminate and develop more knowledge, patents and scientific information in Colombia, specially the information and data that is relevant to design, develop and implement AI systems.11. Attract international talent and skilled labor: <br/>The Government should develop an AI market that attracts international talent and not only relies on Colombian’s expertise on this matter. Consequently, one of the priorities set forth by the Government is to design programs that allow AI experts from all over the world to see Colombia and its market as a possible destination. The goal is for Colombia to become a regional leader and an orchestrator of several AI projects. Building alliances with international organizations and academic institutions is central for the Government at this point. <br/><br/>12. Evidence-based policies on the future of labor: <br/><br/>The impact of AI on labor markets must be demystified. Therefore, it is necessary to collect evidence that allows the Government to define the real effects of this technology in Colombia’s labor market. Evidence-based policies are essential for Colombia to avoid implementing regulatory measures that can have disruptive effects on its innovation ecosystem. Without this precaution, there can be regulatory measures that may be unnecessary and have a negative impact on the AI Market and on Colombian workers. Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology. To achieve this purpose, Government agencies must consider AI systems in the design of their digital transformation projects. AI should be seen by public officials as a strategic tool that provides several solutions to the challenges of the public sector. AI can be very effective to increase State Capability in Colombia. The Government can use this technology to increase territorial control, improve policy implementation and enable a digital transformation process in public entities, amongst other projects. Therefore, the AI market should serve as a source of solutions for the public sector, where entrepreneurs provide effective and disruptive tools to improve public management. <br/><br/>14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy: <br/>This policy seeks to become one of the most relevant AI strategies in the world. This relevance in the international arena depends on the effective implementation of the measures described in this document. This requires the deployment of policy-tools to ensure its implementation and the sustainability of the actions proposed. The Government will put in place such measures, that should also demonstrate that these are credible commitments. Additionally, policy implementation is relevant to be effective on the policy evaluation process. <br/><br/>15. Continuous interaction with the international community and global experts: <br/>The Government of Colombia acknowledges the leadership exercised by some countries and institutions in the design, development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the Government considers that participating of global networks working on AI is central for this Strategy.",1,0,"1M-5M","Colombia",14,1,2,7,"18706",10,1,3

Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market. Therefore, education programs should provide spaces for policy-makers in education to experiment, learn and introduce rapid changes. Likewise, the Government will develop specific training programs for the workforce already active in the labor market. The Government will provide access to lifelong learning projects and platforms. Additionally, it will design and implement intensive training programs for individuals interacting with AI systems. <br/><br/>10. Strategic role of academic research in the development of an AI market: <br/>Colombia has to develop a plan for academic research on AI to be further developed at higher education institutions. This research should become an essential input to develop an AI market in Colombia. It is critical to implement strategies to support researchers working on AI and to facilitate their access to resources. Moreover, the Government wants to facilitate the interaction between academic research and private companies. The main objective is for academic research to play a more relevant role on the creation of corporate R&D and innovation areas in Colombia companies. This also requires a specific plan to disseminate and develop more knowledge, patents and scientific information in Colombia, specially the information and data that is relevant to design, develop and implement AI systems.11. Attract international talent and skilled labor: <br/>The Government should develop an AI market that attracts international talent and not only relies on Colombian’s expertise on this matter. Consequently, one of the priorities set forth by the Government is to design programs that allow AI experts from all over the world to see Colombia and its market as a possible destination. The goal is for Colombia to become a regional leader and an orchestrator of several AI projects. Building alliances with international organizations and academic institutions is central for the Government at this point. <br/><br/>12. Evidence-based policies on the future of labor: <br/><br/>The impact of AI on labor markets must be demystified. Therefore, it is necessary to collect evidence that allows the Government to define the real effects of this technology in Colombia’s labor market. Evidence-based policies are essential for Colombia to avoid implementing regulatory measures that can have disruptive effects on its innovation ecosystem. Without this precaution, there can be regulatory measures that may be unnecessary and have a negative impact on the AI Market and on Colombian workers. Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology. To achieve this purpose, Government agencies must consider AI systems in the design of their digital transformation projects. AI should be seen by public officials as a strategic tool that provides several solutions to the challenges of the public sector. AI can be very effective to increase State Capability in Colombia. The Government can use this technology to increase territorial control, improve policy implementation and enable a digital transformation process in public entities, amongst other projects. Therefore, the AI market should serve as a source of solutions for the public sector, where entrepreneurs provide effective and disruptive tools to improve public management. <br/><br/>14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy: <br/>This policy seeks to become one of the most relevant AI strategies in the world. This relevance in the international arena depends on the effective implementation of the measures described in this document. This requires the deployment of policy-tools to ensure its implementation and the sustainability of the actions proposed. The Government will put in place such measures, that should also demonstrate that these are credible commitments. Additionally, policy implementation is relevant to be effective on the policy evaluation process. <br/><br/>15. Continuous interaction with the international community and global experts: <br/>The Government of Colombia acknowledges the leadership exercised by some countries and institutions in the design, development and deployment of AI. Therefore, the Government considers that participating of global networks working on AI is central for this Strategy.",1,0,"1M-5M","Colombia",14,1,2,7,"19793",10,4,12

Creating an AI Market: <br/>The objective of this policy is to create and develop the most dynamic and thriving AI market in Latin America, and one of the most important AI markets in the world. Colombia will become a laboratory for the creation of its own AI market where designers, suppliers, intermediaries and consumers of this technology can easily interact. This market will become the driving center for the 4IR emerging ecosystem and will keep Colombia in a highly competitive level. Therefore, the Government must build an environment that makes its investment climate more attractive to foreign and local entrepreneurs developing this technology. <br/><br/>2. Prioritize market-creating innovations: <br/>The Government will provide favorable conditions for the design and development of market-creating innovations based on AI systems. These creations are pivotal for the growth of an AI market in Colombia. They can also have a profound impact on the national economy by creating a new environment for business innovation. According to this guideline, the Government responds to the specific demands and changes required by the newborn innovation ecosystem and does not anticipate to them. Therefore, it makes an efficient and effective use of available resources, responding to real needs and not to hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, the Government wants private entrepreneurs to develop this kind of innovations. The Government considers that this is the precise moment for these entrepreneurs to move a step forward and lead the creation of an emerging technology market that has the potential to provide more wealth and opportunities to Colombia’s population. <br/><br/>3. Evidence-based policies and design of impact metrics: <br/>Regulation may put on risk the development of a competitive AI market in Colombia. Therefore, any regulation that has an impact on AI systems must be based on considerable evidence that supports the need for State intervention. Therefore, metrics and indicators should be developed to evaluate the impact of AI systems in society. Once the impact produced by AI systems implemented and deployed in Colombia is measured and defined, there will be proper evidence to design a smart regulatory framework for AI systems. Jointly, this approach will stimulate cost-benefit analysis in the design and implementation of policies and regulations regarding AI systems. <br/><br/>4. Regulatory experimentation: <br/>Considering the impact of regulation, Colombia should also adopt groundbreaking regulatory models for AI systems. Therefore, the Government will support the creation of regulatory sandboxes. Sandboxes allow Governmental Agencies to have access and understand AI systems being deployed in Colombia. Likewise, it allows entrepreneurs to experiment with this technology in a safe and controlled environment. However, the Government must go beyond sandboxes and should consider the design of regulatory beaches. These beaches can help Colombia to develop a complete space of experimentation that even covers entire sectors of the national economy. This model can have several effects, such as, (i) longer-lasting effects; (ii) contribute to the creation of the AI market; (iii) bring a more ambitious cultural change; and (iv) limit the State’s role to the supervision -not the creation- of private innovation. <br/><br/>5. Data infrastructure for AI: <br/>The Government will continue to develop a comprehensive data infrastructure that can be used to design and implement AI systems in Colombia. This is an essential measure required to build a competitive AI Market. The Government's objective is to facilitate data access for AI designers by removing unnecessary and unjustified barriers to have access to this information. Therefore, national Government must promote an ambitious data policy that will facilitate data access and sharing. One of the Government’s priorities is to promote data interoperability and increase the number of public datasets, especially those that contain structured data. Additionally, it is necessary to design models and methodologies that improve the data sharing between different organizations. It is essential that data can be easily shared with entities located in Colombia or abroad. Therefore, the Government will analyze the implementation of data sharing models such as Data Trusts or Data Commons, amongst others. Furthermore, the Government will continue to monitor and promote the implementation of the National Big Data Policy (CONPES document 3920), especially those strategies related to public data access and development of public data infrastructure. Following this principle, the Government will also set clear guidelines to enable cross-border flows of personal data and to facilitate the exchange of such data among different organizations. Colombian data protection regulation must protect citizens considering a risk-management approach.6. AI Market as a tool to achieve social equality and inclusion: <br/>AI systems can provide solutions to Colombia’s marginalized populations. Specific market conditions should be developed for AI to fulfill this purpose. The Government also wants to achieve this purpose by developing inclusive AI systems. One of the first strategies to achieve this goal is to promote the creation of an AI market for non-traditional consumers. Through this market, low-income consumers will also have access to AI solutions offered by entrepreneurs. <br/><br/>7. Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and safety: <br/>The Government acknowledges the ethical discussions and debates surrounding AI systems. There are several challenges that must be addressed. Personal data processing on AI systems and the design of “black box” systems are already controversial issues. This can lead to undesired outcomes, harming most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Jointly, these systems are vulnerable to security breaches which can be highly dangerous, even to physical infrastructure. Several organizations and governments agencies around the globe have proposed a series of ethical principles to protect citizens. Some of the principles proposed are fairness, transparency, non-discrimination, accountability, security and privacy, among others. <br/><br/>The Government of Colombia is aware of this situation and considers the need for ethical principles that guide AI systems design, implementation and deployment. Ethical principles must guide the experimentation ecosystem that is being developed in Colombia and the AI market proposed. For this task several principles must be consider, such as fairness, transparency, freedom, accountability, inclusion and the framework provided by human rights. Additionally, the use of specific tools must be analyzed and carefully consider for these principles to be materialized (e.g. auditing algorithms, code of ethics, etc.). These principles and tools must be designed and discussed with different organizations and sectors, especially with academia and private companies. <br/><br/>The objective of the Government is for the Colombian ethical framework for AI to be a product of consensus among diverse entities. Likewise, the principles proposed must be based on the evidence available around the world and that demonstrate real ethical risks in the design and implementation of AI systems. Therefore, these principles can change from time to time, considering the new evidence that is reported. The Government will track and monitor case studies and evidence that describe ethical challenges that must be addressed. Finally, it is essential to develop standards to address security issues directly related to AI systems (e.g. adversarial attacks). Those standards should help organizations designing or implementing AI systems to protect users, data integrity and digital systems architecture. <br/><br/>8. Credible commitments and consensus building: <br/>The Government of Colombia wants to design and implement a public policy on AI that is based on credible commitments. These commitments are essential to attract foreign investment and provide legal and regulatory certainty. Therefore, the government has developed a series of institutional reforms that provide credibility to this Strategy. Those reforms will be further described in this document. Jointly, the Government considers that credibility and trust are built if the policies proposed are the result of consensus among different sectors and entities. Consensus building is essential for the actions proposed to have cross-cutting effects. <br/><br/>Colombia will successfully enter into the 4RI if there is consensus in the public, private and academic sectors about the changes to come. Finally, institutional reforms are required to facilitate coordination among different agencies. Such a coordination is essential to demonstrate that this AI Strategy is adopted by the entire Government and not by some few agencies or individuals. It also avoids any possible contradictions within Government agencies that can have a negative impact on the implementation and deployment of AI systems. <br/><br/>9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation: <br/>Public policy on education is essential for Colombia to benefit from AI and avoid undesirable scenarios. However, Colombia’s education and talent policies require experimentation and an innovative approach. The growth of AI as a source of efficient and productive solutions also poses a challenge for human talent because automated AI-based systems could replace human workers. This foreseeable situation requires setting strategies for all population groups depending on their current and future needs and skills. People who are currently working in the labor market in positions with high potential to become automated require special attention. This group requires specific training and support to facilitate their transition towards work that will be required and may involve interaction with new technologies. However, there is not enough information and evidence available to define the complete set of skills Colombians should acquire to interact with AI systems in the future. The Government wants to understand and identify the set of kills Colombians should acquire in the next decades and most effective methodologies to obtain them. <br/><br/>The development of an AI Market is central for this purpose. The behavior of this market will allow the Government to identify some of the most relevant skills required to improve the condition of the labor force and that is in demand by companies interacting in this market. Therefore, education programs should provide spaces for policy-makers in education to experiment, learn and introduce rapid changes. Likewise, the Government will develop specific training programs for the workforce already active in the labor market. The Government will provide access to lifelong learning projects and platforms. Additionally, it will design and implement intensive training programs for individuals interacting with AI systems. <br/><br/>10. Strategic role of academic research in the development of an AI market: <br/>Colombia has to develop a plan for academic research on AI to be further developed at higher education institutions. This research should become an essential input to develop an AI market in Colombia. It is critical to implement strategies to support researchers working on AI and to facilitate their access to resources. Moreover, the Government wants to facilitate the interaction between academic research and private companies. The main objective is for academic research to play a more relevant role on the creation of corporate R&D and innovation areas in Colombia companies.

Evidence-based policies are essential for Colombia to avoid implementing regulatory measures that can have disruptive effects on its innovation ecosystem. Without this precaution, there can be regulatory measures that may be unnecessary and have a negative impact on the AI Market and on Colombian workers. Therefore, the Government will monitor the labor market’s behavior considering the implementation and deployment of AI systems. This strategy will allow the Government to identify negative and positive impact of AI and design specific strategies to protect those workers affected. <br/><br/>13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems: <br/>The Government should provide all the necessary conditions for the AI market to keep a competitive level. Therefore, the Government should become one of the major consumers of this technology.

Thus, advances in Spanish language resources and technologies would improve the internationalization of the Spanish HLT industry in the Iber-American Market.<br/><br/>2- Industrial and Economic Perspective:<br/>- HLT sector is growing rapidly in the large multinationals. However, support is needed for the innovative start-ups, spin-off and SMEs in the sector given the role they can play in the national economy. Thus, Plan TL considers this line as one of its principal actions.<br/><br/>3- Legal Perspective:<br/>Building large Language Resources is highly benefiting from legislations concerning Open Public Data. However, on the other hand, building resources should respect the Data Protection such as the GDPR. <br/>In the last two years, main changes direclty affected the action lines of the Language Techonology Plans:<br/>1. Artificial Intelligence Strategies: At the international, EU and national levels, a number of Artificial Intelligence Strategies were published. Given the role of HLT as an indispensable component of AI, the Language Technologies Plan (Plan TL) had to join efforts with these efforts and initiatives towards AI strategies.<br/>2. Connecting Europe Facilities Programme and the participation of the Plan TL in different projects funded by CEF contributed in going further steps towards applying results of research and academic in offering services on a wider scale. Moreover, it helped creating more synergies with other EU stakeholders.<br/>3. Initiatives on Open Science such as the European Science Cloud Initiatives were in the core of one of the Flagship Projects concerning R&D&I Policy Making where HLT are introduced to landscape the RDI space in patents, publications, projects, grants, etc.<br/>4. European initiatives for Interoperability in Public Administration also had an impact on the action lines of the Plan TL since interoperable datasets and components are crucial for the advancement of the HLT industry and the Public Services.<br/>5. SuperComputing and High Performance Computers are also changing the panorama in the last two years. Plan TL contemplated the integration of HPC in its action lines, especially for the deployment of NLP platforms and for applying deep learning techniques to calculate language models over large datasets.","To foster the development of the Human Language Technologies sector in Spain, and to take advantage of these novel capabilities to improve and innovate public services. <br/><br/>Human Language Tecnologies include 5 cross-cutting technical lines: <br/>1. Natural Language Processing <br/>2. Machine Translation<br/>3. Speech Processing and Dialogue Sistems <br/>4. Language Resources <br/>5. Machine and Deep Learning Models and Algorithms.Four Specific Objectives represent the structure of Plan TL:<br/>i. Development of linguistic infrastuctures in Spanish and co-oficial languages (Catalan, Basque and Galician) in terms of language resources and processing platforms. Language resources include large corpora, i.e. datasets, of textual, spoken or multimodal data. Processing platforms include processing components and pipelines.Technical and Semantic interoperability are in the centre of these resources.ii. Promoting HLT Industry by supporting the following actions:<br/>- Enhancing the visibility of the Spanish HLT industry and the products and services they offer. This visibility contemplates both the national and the European levels as innovative technologies and enables for the European Digital Single Market.<br/>- Encouraging knowledge transfer from academia to industry in the sector.<br/>- Supporting SMEs and innovative start-ups.<br/>- Improving the internationalization of the Spanish HLT captitalizing on the high potential of Spanish in the Ibero-American market.iii. Public Administrations as drivers of the language industry. This line contemplates two main roles of Public Administrations as: <br/>a) Data-Providers for Language Resources capitalizing on the principles of ""Open Public Data"" as valuable sources for developing linguistic infrastuctures. Access and use of these datasets is possible within legislative frameworks such as the European Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information, also known as the ‘Open Data Directive’ (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) or other national legislations.<br/>b) Users by introducing HLT within their workflows and, thus, to improve the quality, efficiency and capacity of the public services offered to the citizen. There are two main types of users: The Policy/Decision Maker and the Civil Servant implementing the different processes. The capacity of HLT to process large volumes of data in different formats are highly useful for data-driven and knowledge-based policy making. On the other hand, introducing HLT in some processes of the daily work of the Civil Servant could make some action more efficient by saving time and effort.<br/>Finally, citizens are considered as an indirect beneficiary of such innovation in public services.iv. Flagship Projects:<br/>These are domain specific projects aiming at applying HLT in specific public services with high social impact such as Health, Justice, R&D&I Policy Making, Cultural Heritage, etc. The scope of these flagship projects encompass the entire value chain to end up with ready products and services.",1,0,"50M-100M","Spain",21,2,2,2,"13231",4,1,3

The program seeks to accelerate and strengthen a global dynamics of the French higher education, research and innovation system.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the National Agency for Research (ANR) is the main operator of the state for the PIA's higher education and research actions.",2010,NA,NA,"The Investments for the Future Programme was set by a Finance Law of March 9, 2010. The goals of this programme and the amount budgeted are structured in accordance to the 2009 report and recommendations issued by a consultative commission chaired by two previous French Prime ministers, MM. Juppé and Rocard. <br/><br/>The ambition of the PIA is to increase the long-term growth potential of the French economy, by strengthening investment in four priority sectors : higher education and research, industries and SMEs, sustainable development and digital economy.<br/><br/>Until this day, the PIA consists of three phases :<br/><br/>- The first phase (PIA 1) covers the period 2010-2020 with a total budget of USD 40.9 billion PPP (EUR 35 billion) allocated to five priority axes as follows : <br/>• Higher education and training: USD 12.4 billion PPP (EUR 11 billion) <br/>• Research: USD 9.2 billion PPP (EUR 7.9 billion) <br/>• Industrial sectors and SMEs: USD 7.6 billion PPP (EUR 6.5 billion) <br/>• Sustainable development: USD 6 billion PPP (EUR 5.1 billion) <br/>• Digital economy: USD 5.3 billion PPP (EUR 4.5 billion).<br/><br/>- The second phase (PIA 2) covers the period 2013-2025 with a total budget of USD 14.3 billion PPP (EUR 12 billion). Its objective is to improve the growth potential of the French economy by organising technological research activities in global excellence clusters. It financially supports the development of new excellence schemes. It will provide about USD 4.8 billion PPP (EUR 4 billion) to support new scientific projects. Innovation is the corner stone of this second phase and partnerships between public research centres and industrials are promoted.<br/><br/>- The third phase (PIA 3) with a total budget of EUR 10 billion was set by the Finance Law for 2017 of December 26, 2016. Of the EUR 10 billion, EUR 5.9 billion will benefit the teaching, research and development of it. This phase includes, for example, calls for projects to support the development of digital technologies. In particular, a part of the “Innovation Contest” is allocated to support innovative digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, blockchain, big data, etc.","Encourage the excellences of higher education and research on large campuses with the best international standards in terms of governance and academic level.<br/><br/>During the first and the second phases of the Investments for the Future Program, the ambition of the « Initiatives d'excellence / Initiatives - Science – Innovation –Territoires – Economie » action (IDEX / I-SITE) is to allow best campuses to promote their specific advantages in order to increase their international visibility and attractiveness.<br/>In particular, the IDEX / I-SITE action selected :<br/>- IDEX in order to create world-leading research universities with leading scientific power and impact in broad areas of knowledge ;<br/>- I-SITE so as to help universities with more concentrated, distinctive and internationally recognized thematic scientific assets to emerge. These assets are a point of support for their strategy of development and partnership with the economic world.<br/><br/>The third phase of the Investments for the Future Program aims to intensify the transformation of the higher education and research system through the creation of « Grandes universités de recherche » (GUR action), of « Ecoles universitaires de recherche » (EUR action) and through the « support to European Universities » : <br/>- when their IDEX or their I-SITE is confirmed (4 are already confirmed, 15 are about to be evaluated in one or two years), universities are allowed to lead initiatives with the support of GUR action to deepen their integrative politicies of excellency ;<br/>- all over the national territory, universities and schools can create EUR bringing together Master's and PhD programs as well as high-caliber research laboratories, ensuring that the projects cooperate strongly with research organizations, have a strong international outreach and maintain close links with economic players. <br/>- when selected by the European Commission or ranked at a high level by the Commission, all the french institutions coordinating a European university project or participating as members of a European university alliance can pretend a support from the PIA. The ambition is to help french institutions to be leaders in cooperation among Europe’s institutions of higher education in every fields of activity, teaching, research, and innovation.Increase the research potential and provide the laboratories and scientific communities with top-level research equipment, mainly shared and networked (consistent with the national research infrastructures roadmap and to ESFRI), including research infrastructures dedicated to public health and SHS.<br/><br/>During the first and the second phases of the Investments for the Future Program, many actions have this two closely linked goals : the « Laboratoires d’excellence » action (LABEX), the ""Equipements d'excellence"" action (EQUIPEX), the « Santé and Biotechnologies » action (Infrastructures nationales de recherche en biologie santé, Démonstrateurs préindustriels en biotechnologies, Cohortes), the « Instituts hospitalo-universitaires » action (IHU) and the « recherche hospitalo-universitaire » action (RHU). <br/>The third phase of the Investments for the Future Program pursues the same goals : the « Equipements structurants pour la recherche » action (ESR) attempts to create new top-level research equipments, in particular in digital domain, and the « Programmes prioritaires de recherche » action (PPR) allows to support research programs in specific fields (environmental and global issues, artificial intelligence, antibioresistance, agriculture and health, sport).Invest in the key technologies and support investment in digital.Develop the higher education and public research institutions capabilities to manage, develop and finance technology transfer policies.",1,1,"More than 500M","France",25,5,6,1,"9931",2,3,15

It is a first step towards initiating concrete measures to achieve the intended acceleration and national profiling. To achieve its goals, the government cooperates with the Dutch AI Coalition. Here, companies, government agencies, knowledge institutions and educational institutions will work together to implement new AI actions that help the specific domains and sectors.",2019,NA,NA,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is radically changing the world. AI will make a substantial contribution to the economic growth, prosperity and well-being of the Netherlands. It will also be of huge importance in solving societal issues, such as the ageing of the Dutch population, climate change, food safety, and health care. At the same time, we must not close our eyes to challenges such as the protection of fundamental rights as privacy, non-discrimination and autonomy.<br/>If the Netherlands and Europe want to be at the forefront of a globally competitive economy, we must accelerate the development and application of AI in the Netherlands. We can do so. The Netherlands is in an excellent position to take on this challenge, partly due to its high-quality connectivity, strong foundation for public–private partnerships (PPP) and world-class research. We must make good use of this strong starting position and develop it further so that the Netherlands can profile itself internationally.<br/>The government focuses on three tracks. Track 1 is that we must seize the societal and economic opportunities. This goal requires intensive PPPs, which will enable the Netherlands to stand out on the European playing field and in global markets. It will be companies, from start-ups and scale-ups to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations, that will make the difference in terms of innovation and competitiveness. They will determine whether the Netherlands will lead the way in AI or whether it follows other countries in this area. They also determine whether AI applications will add value to the economy and society. This added value can result from responding to societal challenges, or from quickly responding to the demands of the market. As a result, the government is developing this track in public private partnership, particularly with the Dutch AI Coalition, while calling on companies and organisations to join the coalition.<br/>Track 2 intends to put in their place the required conditions for a fruitful AI climate for economy and society. These conditions include the necessary knowledge, skills and training; top-quality scientific AI research, as well as applied research the results of which are useful to businesses and professionals. They also include access to usable data as well as high-quality and smart connectivity. In this context, we are investing in research programmes and training, increasing access to innovation funding for start-ups, promoting data-sharing, and further developing digital connectivity with and for AI.<br/>Track 3 is about ""Strengthening the foundations"". This track concerns the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights, as well as appropriate legal and ethical frameworks. As a result, people and companies can feel confident that AI will be used responsibly. It is also important that markets remain open and competitive, and that with all AI developments national security is safeguarded. To this end, necessary legislation and regulations are already in force or in the making. In addition, the government monitors AI developments and continues to stimulate the use of (European) ethical guidelines for AI applications by companies as well as public organisations.","To capitalise on societal and economic opportunities: policies encouraging the adoption, use and development of AI in the private and public sector and promoting the use of AI to tackle societal challenges.To create the right conditions: policies supporting education and skills development in AI; fostering research and innovation in AI, facilitating the access to qualitative data and improving the digital infrastructure;To strenghten the foundations: including policy actions related to ethical issues, such as trust, human rights, consumer protection, and safety of citizens.",4,0,"50M-100M","Netherlands",44,1,1,6,"19433",10,1,3
