The program seeks to accelerate and strengthen a global dynamics of the French higher education, research and innovation system.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the National Agency for Research (ANR) is the main operator of the state for the PIA's higher education and research actions.","2010","","","The Investments for the Future Programme was set by a Finance Law of March 9, 2010. The goals of this programme and the amount budgeted are structured in accordance to the 2009 report and recommendations issued by a consultative commission chaired by two previous French Prime ministers, MM. Juppé and Rocard. <br/><br/>The ambition of the PIA is to increase the long-term growth potential of the French economy, by strengthening investment in four priority sectors : higher education and research, industries and SMEs, sustainable development and digital economy.<br/><br/>Until this day, the PIA consists of three phases :<br/><br/>- The first phase (PIA 1) covers the period 2010-2020 with a total budget of USD 40.9 billion PPP (EUR 35 billion) allocated to five priority axes as follows : <br/>• Higher education and training: USD 12.4 billion PPP (EUR 11 billion) <br/>• Research: USD 9.2 billion PPP (EUR 7.9 billion) <br/>• Industrial sectors and SMEs: USD 7.6 billion PPP (EUR 6.5 billion) <br/>• Sustainable development: USD 6 billion PPP (EUR 5.1 billion) <br/>• Digital economy: USD 5.3 billion PPP (EUR 4.5 billion).<br/><br/>- The second phase (PIA 2) covers the period 2013-2025 with a total budget of USD 14.3 billion PPP (EUR 12 billion). Its objective is to improve the growth potential of the French economy by organising technological research activities in global excellence clusters. It financially supports the development of new excellence schemes. It will provide about USD 4.8 billion PPP (EUR 4 billion) to support new scientific projects. Innovation is the corner stone of this second phase and partnerships between public research centres and industrials are promoted.<br/><br/>- The third phase (PIA 3) with a total budget of EUR 10 billion was set by the Finance Law for 2017 of December 26, 2016. Of the EUR 10 billion, EUR 5.9 billion will benefit the teaching, research and development of it. This phase includes, for example, calls for projects to support the development of digital technologies. In particular, a part of the “Innovation Contest” is allocated to support innovative digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, blockchain, big data, etc.","Encourage the excellences of higher education and research on large campuses with the best international standards in terms of governance and academic level.<br/><br/>During the first and the second phases of the Investments for the Future Program, the ambition of the « Initiatives d'excellence / Initiatives - Science – Innovation –Territoires – Economie » action (IDEX / I-SITE) is to allow best campuses to promote their specific advantages in order to increase their international visibility and attractiveness.<br/>In particular, the IDEX / I-SITE action selected :<br/>- IDEX in order to create world-leading research universities with leading scientific power and impact in broad areas of knowledge ;<br/>- I-SITE so as to help universities with more concentrated, distinctive and internationally recognized thematic scientific assets to emerge. These assets are a point of support for their strategy of development and partnership with the economic world.<br/><br/>The third phase of the Investments for the Future Program aims to intensify the transformation of the higher education and research system through the creation of « Grandes universités de recherche » (GUR action), of « Ecoles universitaires de recherche » (EUR action) and through the « support to European Universities » : <br/>- when their IDEX or their I-SITE is confirmed (4 are already confirmed, 15 are about to be evaluated in one or two years), universities are allowed to lead initiatives with the support of GUR action to deepen their integrative politicies of excellency ;<br/>- all over the national territory, universities and schools can create EUR bringing together Master's and PhD programs as well as high-caliber research laboratories, ensuring that the projects cooperate strongly with research organizations, have a strong international outreach and maintain close links with economic players. <br/>- when selected by the European Commission or ranked at a high level by the Commission, all the french institutions coordinating a European university project or participating as members of a European university alliance can pretend a support from the PIA. The ambition is to help french institutions to be leaders in cooperation among Europe’s institutions of higher education in every fields of activity, teaching, research, and innovation.Increase the research potential and provide the laboratories and scientific communities with top-level research equipment, mainly shared and networked (consistent with the national research infrastructures roadmap and to ESFRI), including research infrastructures dedicated to public health and SHS.<br/><br/>During the first and the second phases of the Investments for the Future Program, many actions have this two closely linked goals : the « Laboratoires d’excellence » action (LABEX), the ""Equipements d'excellence"" action (EQUIPEX), the « Santé and Biotechnologies » action (Infrastructures nationales de recherche en biologie santé, Démonstrateurs préindustriels en biotechnologies, Cohortes), the « Instituts hospitalo-universitaires » action (IHU) and the « recherche hospitalo-universitaire » action (RHU). <br/>The third phase of the Investments for the Future Program pursues the same goals : the « Equipements structurants pour la recherche » action (ESR) attempts to create new top-level research equipments, in particular in digital domain, and the « Programmes prioritaires de recherche » action (PPR) allows to support research programs in specific fields (environmental and global issues, artificial intelligence, antibioresistance, agriculture and health, sport).Invest in the key technologies and support investment in digital.Develop the higher education and public research institutions capabilities to manage, develop and finance technology transfer policies.","High Commissioner for Investment (CGI;Commissariat général à l'investissement)","http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/pid24578/investissements-d-avenir.html","true","","More than 500M","France","Emerging trends in STI policy|Governance|Innovation in firms and innovative entrepreneurship|Public research system|Science-industry knowledge transfer and sharing","Artificial intelligence (AI)|Commercialisation of public research results|Competitive research funding|Financial support to business R&D and innovation|National STI plan or strategy|Research infrastructures and large equipment","Research and education organisations","Higher education institutes|Public research institutes","http://stip.oecd.org/2019/data/policyInitiatives/3907/instrument/9931","Direct financial support","Institutional funding for public research","INVESTMENTS FOR THE FUTURE PROGRAMME","","","Criteria for funding: Research impact, Research infrastructure, Commercialisation of research-generated intellectual property, Scientific partnerships and collaborations, Other|Funding amount allocated for an average time-period of: 7 years or more|Funding includes a teaching component: No|Funding is attached to: None of the above|Penalties and rewards associated to performance: None of the above|Performance-based element to the allocation: Yes"
