The principles reflect Danish values and have been prepared on the basis of the recommendations from the Expert Group on Data Ethics set up under the Danish Disruption Council, and the draft EU ethical principles and guidelines for artificial intelligence.<br/>Six principles for artificial intelligence:<br/>1. Self-determination<br/>People’s autonomy should have priority in development and use of artificial intelligence. Like today, people should be able to make informed and independent decisions without artificial<br/>intelligence removing their self-determination.<br/>2. Dignity<br/>Human dignity should be respected in development and use of artificial intelligence.<br/>Artificial intelligence should not cause injury, it should support due process and it should not unjustifiably place people in a worse position. Artificial intelligence should respect democracy and democratic processes, and it should not be used to infringe fundamental human rights.<br/>3. Responsibility<br/>All levels should be responsible for the consequences of their development and use of artificial intelligence, i.e. developers, cooperation partners, users, authorities, businesses, etc.<br/>In decisions and decision-support based on artificial intelligence, it should be possible to place responsibility on human beings.<br/>4. Explainability<br/>Explainability means that you can describe, control and restore data, underlying logics and consequences of the use of artificial intelligence, e.g. by being able to trace and explain<br/>decisions and decision support. Explainability is not the same as full transparency of algorithms, as there are business interests in the private sector, for example. However, the<br/>public authorities have a special responsibility to ensure openness and transparency in the use of algorithms.<br/>5. Equality and justice<br/>Artificial intelligence should not reproduce prejudices that marginalise specific population groups. There will be active work to prevent unwanted bias and promote designs that avoid classification discriminating on ethnicity, sexuality and gender, for example. Demographic and professional diversity should be guiding parameters in working with artificial intelligence.<br/>The government will regularly follow up on the principles, among other things after discussions with the Data Ethics Council. The follow-up will take into account the differences between the public and private sectors. The public sector is subject to the Danish Public Administration Act and the Danish Access to Public Administration Files Act, for example, whereas businesses may need to protect trade secrets.<br/>6. Development<br/>Artificial intelligence can help forge great progress for society. Technical and organisational solutions should be developed that support ethically responsible development and use of<br/>artificial intelligence in order to achieve the greatest possible progress for society, e.g. by contributing to better public-sector services and to growth in the business community.","","Activities: Provide guidance, advice and support to stakeholders|Challenge(s) addressed: Risks to human safety, Privacy protection, Social disruption (e.g. job insecurity), Unethical use (e.g. dual-use technologies), Security (e.g. discrimination)|Reports are publicly available: Yes|Reports to: Head of national government|The coordination body is composed of: Mostly government representatives|Type(s) of oversight or advice: Ethical principles (e.g. integrity, accountability, impartiality)"
